Apparently, commercial bananas are under threat due to their lack of genetic diversity, making them prone to fungal diseases -- another variation, \"Big Mike\", went the way of the buffalo in the 60s for the same reason. I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning.
