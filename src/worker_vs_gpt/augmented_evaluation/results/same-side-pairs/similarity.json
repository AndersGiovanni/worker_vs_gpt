[SEP] I back the idea that marriage was instituted as a union between one man and one woman, not between individuals of the same sex.

The world now a days is creating so many new ideas and making up things that long time ago didn't exist, such as gay marriage. In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women. It ist something that people came up with 2000 years ago and it should not be changed.

The traditional definition of marriage is between a man and a woman and it should stay that way. It's not appropriate for men to mimic female behaviors and physical attributes, nor is it natural for people to surgically alter their appearance to resemble the opposite sex. [SEP] I concur with the perspective that matrimony has been and should continue to be the union of a male and female, not a same-sex couple. This was a concept people proposed 2000 years ago and shouldn't be altered. It's inappropriate for males to impersonate females and it's definitely unnatural for individuals to seek surgical procedures to resemble the opposite gender.",
