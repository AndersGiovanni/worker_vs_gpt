In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women.

In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women. It ist something that people came up with 2000 years ago and it should not be changed.

In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women. It ist something that people came up with 2000 years ago and it should not be changed.

In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women. It ist something that people came up with 2000 years ago and it should not be changed.

The Left's fixation on gun control is a red herring that distracts from the real issues behind mass shootings. We need to address the breakdown of family structures, improve mental health resources, and enforce existing laws to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.",

In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women. It ist something that people came up with 2000 years ago and it should not be changed.
