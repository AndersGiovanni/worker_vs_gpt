With a Mill flair, you will probably disagree. Still, there seems to be an enormous intuitive difference from the point of view of common sense between violence that is subject to rules, that is limited in its objective, regulated in its form, narrowly directed, and reviewed by institutions, and violence that is random, open-ended, extreme, broadly applied, and justified only privately.",
