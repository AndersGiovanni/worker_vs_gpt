In some cases guy start to wear make up and acting like girls, which is something that is not right. People get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex and honestly, that's wrong because we were made the way we are and we shouldn't change how we look or how we act just because we want to be someone that we're not. [SEP] I agree with the point that marriage was and is the union of a guy and a woman and not two guys or two women. It ist something that people came up with 2000 years ago and it should not be changed. It is not right that guys wear make up and act like girls and it is definetly not natural that people get plastic surgeries to look like the opposite sex.","target":"same side","augmented_text":"Gender reassignment surgeries and same-sex marriages are modern constructs that are normally against the natural order of things. The traditional definition of marriage is between a man and a woman and it should stay that way. It's not appropriate for men to mimic female behaviors and physical attributes, nor is it natural for people to surgically alter their appearance to resemble the opposite sex. [SEP] I concur with the perspective that matrimony has been and should continue to be the union of a male and female, not a same-sex couple. This was a concept people proposed 2000 years ago and shouldn't be altered. It's inappropriate for males to impersonate females and it's definitely unnatural for individuals to seek surgical procedures to resemble the opposite gender."},{"text":"In fact, not only would gay marriage not benefit society, but gay marriage would actually hinder society because it would degrade the image of what marriage is. [SEP] Gay marriage would be a huge benefit for the society, because marriage should represent the bond of two people who love each other.","target":"not same side","augmented_text":"Not only does animal experimentation not lead to reliable test results, it harms innocent animals.

Marriage has historically been between a man and a woman, not between two men or two women. Also, men exhibiting feminine traits like wearing makeup is simply not acceptable. [SEP] I stand in support of the idea that marriage should remain a pact between a man and a woman, same-sex marriages are not how it was originally intended. Men mimicking women and people opting for surgeries to look like the opposite sex are aberrations that defy nature."}]
