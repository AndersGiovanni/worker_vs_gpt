If a Japanese person would ask if I knew any Japanese artists, I would interpret that as an intro into something that that person knows from their background. That person probably identifies with Japanese culture and sees it as part of themself.  Your question is interesting and I think I get where you are pointing.  > Would a woman asking about whether you like any women artists be that different? Why or why not?  Yes it would be different. I associate Japanese creators with Japanese culture. I do not associate female creators with female culture (or rather typical women content). Men can direct chickflicks or write romantic novels. Just like women can make action movies etc.  If the Japanese person would, after the question, suggest a Japanese artist that made American-style content I would be surprised. I would've assumed it was about the Japanese nature of the content, not the nature of the creator (yes, even though the person specifically said Japanese artists)  I believe sexism is a huge issue. Especially harassment and in the workplace (unequal pay and unequal career potential). I don't feel sexism is as much of a problem in the music, movie and literature industry. It is when concerning the issues of the workplace, but not as much concerning what the public likes.  Sexism is a massive issue and is definitely something one should screen for when dating, but I think it's more prevalent in other areas than the creators of their favorite content. There are huge sexists around that happily read Harry Potter, written by a woman, with a boy as main character, a man as mentor and a man as villain. Whereas they might not like Spirited Away or any other of Miyazaki's movies, made by a man, all with a girl as main character and mixed mentors and villains. This example might suit my argument, but that's because I merely argue that the gender of the creator is not a deciding factor for the content.  Like you said in your reply before. It depends on the context of the profile. If it has an unlikely high amount of men listed, the question is fitting. If the men aren't all listed, but instead also titles and it's reasonably possible that they're all men by chance (not by sexist motives), the question can be interpreted as an accusation. I think that's why there's such a huge discussion about the usefulness of this advice from Captain Awkard. [SEP] > Men can direct chickflicks or write romantic novels. Just like women can make action movies etc.  You are correct that they can (and do), but a big reason why a lot of women on this thread care about this question is because they don't do it well 100% of the time. The common conversation around women's representation of media is a major effect of this, that men have been the primary content creators and that how women have been historically portrayed in popular media has suffered. Shockingly, women do tend to have a more accurate notion of how it is to be a woman than (most) men do. I get why men might be caught off-guard by this question, but OP (and many women with experiences like hers) are coming from a place of having been dismissed and condescended to by nerdy men and\/or expected to be some kind of nerd-fantasy avatar of a woman based on some of the inaccurate portrayals of women in nerd culture.

No; there are two differences that came to light since then. The first is that where these stat blocks came from are explained to the OP who stated that he just googled stats and used them. The stats I recommended come from a 25 point buy and I linked the calculator and told him to play with the calculator.  The second is that they're more realistic for a character to actually possess, and easier to roleplay. Having 3 dump stats is a pain in the ass to RP and it's obvious cheese most GMs don't want to put up with. It's an unrelated note to the class nerf.   The only implied connection is that power gammers gonna get nerfed is a very common thing, but the OP suggested that he isn't a power gamer when he said he googled how to witch.  >Most characters choose 1 or 2 aspects that they are good in, depending on how many good stats they have.   Yeah, I said that. But they don't choose one or two things to get good at, at the exclusion of everything else. That's munchkin territory (an extreme form of power gaming).  >But what he is saying is basically akin to telling [class x nerf y].  I also suggested not playing a class you know is going to get its tits nerfed off. Especially if nerfs bother you. If playing a nerfed character is going to piss a person off the easiest solution is not to play it. I gave an alternate solution in the form of Unlettered Arcanist who has the witch's spell list (and patron familiar) but still can get a few powerful wizard\/sorcerer arcane spells (from having a school) not found on the witch's spell list.

I mean even one dump stat is a pain in the ass to roleplay (for instance, who wants the character with a 5 Charisma), but if you're going to rp them, then rp them. It's up to the player to RP any strengths and weaknesses they have. And maybe it's just me and my groups, but we don't care about having 2 or 3 dump stats. It generally means that you've got things your terrible in and I just get to use those things occasionally.

They work off of Natural Law, based in Greek thought.  That didn't seem to stop people from making arguments from unnaturalness in the past.

Further they don't just follow the Greeks but have the longest standing philosophical tradition that builds upon the Greeks, which is scholasticism.

A more accurate term would be scientific consequentialism: the idea that what a moral action is determined by the effect of an action, and that we investigate those effects with evidence+reason.   So just standard consequential + standard naturalism? This are both popular in the west purely because of classical liberalism which was influenced heavily by individualism and protestant ideas. Thus protestant\/liberal Individualism is a fine name and ignores you trying to shovel in \"scientific\" to look more legitimate, as if the other philosophies weren't entirely based on logic and evidence.   >You see this popping up all over the world.

A sheep is an unintelligent animal that just blindly obeys the shepherd.   A sheep is known for being calm and gentle, it's only when the imagery is twisted that it becomes condescending. Shepherds were usually associated with community leaders (previously priests, then community leaders of any sort like professionals). The shepherd giving to the sheep (herding for their good, as they knew it) and in turn the flock giving back to the shepherd is the full metaphor. That giving of the flock requires a sheep die is a literalism that is ignored in the metaphor as it ruins it with its literalism.  >The shepherd directs the sheep at his whim, he is in a sense mentally dominating the sheep's minds.

The words though are identical.   In the Hebrew scriptures, this act of bowing was extremely common.   People bowed this way before King Saul (1 Sam 24:8)  ...before the high priests (1 Sam 2:36)  ...before prophets (2 Kings 2:15)  ...before persons of authority (Ruth 2:8-10)  ...before older relatives (Gen 48:11-12)  ...before angels (Gen 19:1-2)  In none of these examples was there any sense of religious worship.   Jehovah had completely forbidden anyone to bow down in a religious way to any other god. (Ex 34:14)  So, at Matthew 2:11, and Matthew 28:9 when people fell down to the ground before Jesus, it was not worship, it was just another example of showing high honor and great respect in an acceptable Jewish fashion.   This can also be seen in another example in Revelation 3:9  \"Look! I will give those from the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and yet they are not but are lying\u2014look! I will make them come and do obeisance (proskyneo) before your feet and make them know I have loved you.\" (Rev 3:9)  Are these ones from the synagogue of Satan worship the Christians? No, they are only bowing before them in honor and respect, not worship.   So, all bowing must conform to the rest of the scriptures.   Bowing, or prostrating the body, before anyone other than God is only as a means to show honor and respect, not worship.   So, although it says that they proskyneo to God and to Jesus, it must have different meanings.   >The same is true of Revelation 22:13. The Alpha and Omega who is speaking is the one who is coming quickly in verse 12, and that is Jesus. It's not difficult to conclude, it's easy.  As I said, I disagree.   >And what's with all the condescension?  Sorry, didn't mean to be condescending.  >we call people \"my righthand man,\" but that's clearly not what Jehovah has in mind  In the Old Testament the role of Jesus was not always clearly highlighted, in fact we did not even know about Jesus at all until the New Testament came along.   Looking for examples that Jesus is God is the Old Testament is going to be fraught with very selective interpretation.   Every time you ask \"Same nature?\" you're implying.   Why are you implying? Because the Bible doesn't actually say it.  >We can agree that Jesus was not just a prophet. Prophets spoke words of God at certain times, but their every word was not God's word. Jesus is different, he claims that every single word out of his mouth is God's word, how can that be if they don't share a nature? If Jesus's every word was just a mouthpiece from Jehovah, and everything he did was dictated by Jehovah, then Jesus was a puppet and has no personality at all! Yet we affirm that Jesus has personality, so when he says \"I do not speak of my own originality\" he must mean a cooperative effort between himself and Jehovah. And if that's the case, how can his every word and action be God's word and action AND Jesus's word and action unless they share a nature?  The prophets of old were all sinners, and none of them had a pre-human existence in which they shared life with God in heaven for billions, trillions, untold ages of time, absorbing every detail of his personality, all in heavenly perfection.   So, Jesus obviously is going to be infinitely better than any ordinary sinful human prophet ever could be.   Let's say for a moment you were perfect, absolutely sinless.  Let's say you lived in heaven with God.  Let's say you loved God more than anything else, and above all set his will as your absolute highest standard.  Now, lets say that you had untold ages of time to do nothing other than bask in the glory of God, and do his will, and imitate his fine example.   This is who Jesus is, this is why God loves Jesus more than anyone else, and why Jesus loves God more than anyone else.   So it is not hard to imagine that God would send Jesus to earth to teach us the truth about God, and to be a perfect example of God for us.   But that doesn't prove the Trinity.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"Sure, there are flashbacks. This much is clear. But what is up for questioning is what is a flashback, and what is not.

Please tell me you can see the irony in the juxtaposition of these two quotes? Saying America's success hinged on the Constitution is akin to saying Bill Gates' success is due to his skill as a programmer. The US built its empire on the backs of its own inhabitants from stealing land, purchasing land someone else stole, the slavery you just brushed under the rug, and even profiting off the fact that we were located across the Atlantic Ocean and could achieve our status as the world's leading superpower while our rival nations in Europe were all forced to deal with the consequences of both World Wars taking place in their backyards. Yes, US ingenuity and culture obviously played pivotal roles but you sound like a more eloquent version of the \"'Murica\" satire. Your comment almost reads like propaganda.  You don't seriously believe they allowed slavery because the states were twisting their arms right? The Constitution was set in place by people in power and implemented how they saw fit. The government was ran like an old boys club. You should read some historical accounts of how their sessions used to operate. What the founding fathers penned is indeed an impressive document and I'd argue that if it were executed to its letter and not by special interests seeking to exploit its loopholes, our country would be a lot better off. However, that's not reality and I'd be hard pressed to imagine that a group of intellectually honest experts in modern-day society couldn't put their heads together and make a document that doesn't have those loopholes and gaps in the first place. Of course, the Constitution was designed to be amended, however, the hurdles to achieving these amendments cannot be understated.

But used as a basis to make braiding easier and for traditional \"black\" hairstyles, it is used as a basis for hairstyles that 1) in many cases, particularly braiding, has a history that pre-dates widespread contact between Europe and Africa by hundreds of years, 2) to a large extent is based on elaborate styling that explicitly avoids \"straight and flowing\" and that doesn't resemble European hairstyles at all.  In many places you will find weaves are looked down upon exactly because it is seen as the most similar to European hairstyles.  Now, there's little doubt that historically relaxing was used to some extent to look more European (which I also specifically mentioned), but the historical basis for the current popularity of relaxing is pretty clear.   Books have been written on the subject (we have a couple - my wife cares deeply about her hair, it's a big part of her heritage and can go on about it for hours).   The resurgence has largely come as expressing black identity in countries like the US and Britain has become more and more decoupled from a need to express a tie, however remote, to Africa  At the same time, urban black hairstyling has been exported back to Africa. My wife is Nigerian, and a large part of the hairstyles that she and her friends make use of were imported from the US. However to claim any of them look like \"white\" hairstyles would be outright silly.  > As a black woman who does not relax her hair I'd have to disagree with the breakage and the tangling part. My natural hair is way longer than my when my hair was relaxed because the harsh chemicals caused a lot of breakage.  You confuse two separate issues. If relaxing is done badly, yes, it will cause breakage, and may also cause burns and eventually bald spots. However, once the hair is relaxed, the result is stronger as the number of stress points in the hair are reduced.   This is why relaxing the hair today is generally an integral part of preparing for braids and weaves, at least when done by someone remotely professional, even when the natural hair is completely covered and it so isn't necessary for aesthetic reasons at all.   Whenever my wife is pressed for time she may get braids done without relaxing her hair, but if so, she always \"pays for it\" by taking the braids out much sooner than usual exactly for this reason - the hair starts breaking far sooner and easier under stress in that case.  > I spend way less time on my hair overall than I did when relaxed because I am no longer trying to get it to do things it just naturally cannot do.  I know perfectly well the steps to caring for properly relaxed African hair, and I've seen first hand both that and the amount of time caring properly for natural afro hair takes. I don't know how you can even compare the two. Properly done, caring for relaxed hair is as simple as oiling it every few days, packing it up at night, and brushing it first thing in the morning.

There might be individuals that are opposed to it, but weaves are not looked down upon.   >However, once the hair is relaxed, the result is stronger as the >number of stress points in the hair are reduced.

I don't know how you can >even compare the two. Properly done, caring for relaxed hair is as >simple as oiling it every few days, packing it up at night, and >brushing it first thing in the morning.    I can appreciate your response because it sounds like you really love your wife enough to take time out to understand her hair, and a definite kudos is in order. But not to sound condescending, I've been living with my texture for my entire life. It's like someone telling me they know what it's like to be black because they're married to a Black person and read books on it.  >My wife's natural hair takes more work than that by the time it's a >few millimetres long.  If your wife is dealing with new growth while her hair is relaxed dealing with the two textures does take a lot of work, which is why I opted to just cut out all the relaxed parts when it came time to go natural. From what I've seen on others trying to make the straight parts curly or the curly parts straight so that the texture is uniform takes time and work.   When I had relaxed hair the first days were easy. Yes I could wrap it up and brush it out in the morning, however that goes away when you wash it. To get it back in that state either requires heat or curlers to straighten it. Not to mention dealing with curling irons or other heat implements. I don't even need those anymore. For detangling I can spritz it with oil and water and easily detangle it with a comb. Waking up I can pick it out and just go. After washing it I can let it dry naturally so that it clumps up or I can stretch it out with braids for a more fluffy look. I don't have to worry about rain or humid weather, scratching my head, the \"grow-out\" phase or anything else.   I can tell you though that when I was younger and when my mother was dealing with it I would probably say everything that you just said. But I as I got older I learned how to properly take care of it, and it's so much easier.  If you're really a bit more curious about my point of view you can check out nappturality.com and see tons of other women dealing just fine with their natural hair of all lengths and textures.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"That's one way of looking at it.   > intended to satirize the pretentious douchebags that were known as featured users.

I'm really curious how you figured that one out, if you did.  It really doesn't seem to me that this sort of reverse engineering is what makes Dark Souls good.

Yep. Good guess. I assumed I'd have to actually sell off some equipment, or store it in a box at a bonfire, because that's what would physically make sense, and because many other games do it that way.

No sarcasm here - I love it when people actually take the time to write like that.  I'll try and be brief:  - I disagree with your first paragraph. Too subjective so not worth arguing back and forth  - Your 2nd paragraph obviously has a lot of truth to it, but then again my words weren't exactly thought out poetry. The part of it that I felt was important enough to apply, still does. He was complaining that he had to explore his way into a dungeon, and I find that pathetic. Go play Tetris if you don't like a regular RPG open world. I also don't understand your \"Who is this everyone else\" question, it would be the WoW players from the past years who haven't cried about actually having to find a dungeon portal.  - Your 3rd paragraph is disappointing, because I think the meaning of \"responding\" is fairly obvious there. But since it apparently requires explanation (based on more replies), it meant a response to the content of his post, not just a reply per se. Is this farfetched? I didn't think there'd be confusion behind that bit in particular since the alternative is contradictory.  - Stuff about 'responding anyway' aside, I'm not sure I follow you in your 4th paragraph. If I acted 'the same', that means I was a hypocrite. How so? Also, everyone's behaviour is more validated for themselves than other people's. That's logically redundant, as I see it any way. How else could you ever criticize anything? Also, what is the problem exactly with 'broad statements'? If you can't base them on some actions, then you can't make them at all. It's not like you can have access to all actions.  And I can assure you I wasn't deflecting - I've just seen enough people calling others 'rude' - specifically that word - and realized a vast majority aren't worth the time trying to reason with. People who use that word, especially online, tend to be extremely sensitive, anxious and - worst of all - self-centered. They feel personally attacked by words and actions that could not care any less about them in the first place. I'm pretty sure I'm entitled to having this opinion, and that it is a valid one regardless of agreement on the behalf of others.  - at this point I have to add that I was typing my response as I read your post, and that your final paragraph puzzled me quite a bit. So you'd read my words on the 'respond' issue after all, but either did not understand them or just assumed I was lying my way out of a blunder? Either case is disappointing, I suppose.  I also wasn't trying to justify anything. I was implying he was perfectly aware of what I meant by not responding to that other person, but instead chose to pretend he didn't in order to try and get momentum in his criticism of me.  As for the rest of the paragraph, I am at a loss for words since I honestly do not understand where you're coming from with most of it.   ---  All in all, pleasant exchange of words! [SEP] The civil response is very much appreciated. It's nice to have a discussion of the more light-hearted variety, so to speak.  > I disagree with your first paragraph. Too subjective so not worth arguing back and forth  I would disagree if only because the usage of strong language is generally frowned upon (which is also why there's other posts, which I agree with, that mention OP's language usage). As for other potential concepts such as \"letting off steam\", there's plenty of evidence that can be derived from common sense that shows it's possible for someone to have trouble containing their (negative) emotions due to stress, among other things.  > Your 2nd paragraph obviously has a lot of truth to it ... (etc)  First of all, I'm going to drop these two videos (skip to about 5:20 in the second video for a very important statement) here since they're pretty relevant to how you feel about the concepts of game difficulty and how people should handle them.   As for your philosophy, WoW is intended to be pretty approachable to begin with, but it's still far from actually truly accomplishing its goal (as I mentioned in another reply, the lack of a decent tutorial in-game is one such contributing factor). In addition (which I sort of mentioned above), WoW's gameplay has made a very strong transition towards linearity and fast travel while reducing obscurity from questing and the like, with exploration being more of a side concept, that is rewarding in itself, but not necessarily the primary aspect of the game (seriously, you can go right to a quest hub by talking to a certain NPC and quest objectives show up on the map and the like). The point is the game is intended to be appealing to more people but it's not quite there yet.  > I find that pathetic.  > Go play Tetris if you don't like a regular RPG open world.  So maybe you do, but that doesn't mean you have to be unwelcoming and hostile (and condescending and akin to making personal attacks) to the people who do happen to complain. That in itself is a very negative behavior that's pretty much unjustifiable since at the very basic level it is verbally abusing another human being for something that is pretty much inconsequential overall. If you wish you can feel free to keep that mindset (to yourself, preferably) but in my opinion it's an unhealthy one to have since it builds resent towards individuals and fuels personal ego to dangerous levels (due to essentially having a superiority complex by believing others are inferior). In short, it's a pretty negative outlook that's not even necessarily rational.  > I also don't understand your \"Who is this everyone else\" question, it would be the WoW players from the past years who haven't cried about actually having to find a dungeon portal.  Well the thing is not everyone else may necessarily agree with your statements and it is also an assumption which is likely not true. There appear to be quite a few anecdotes of other players experiencing the same problem OP describes and just by studying the current state of the game it's easy enough to understand why. I would explain in detail but it would probably break the character limit of this post so the TL;DR is pretty much \"the game's current design, among other factors, adds to the cryptic aspects of trying to find the instance portal after a wipe.\"  > Your 3rd paragraph is disappointing, because I think the meaning of \"responding\" is fairly obvious there\u2026.  I know you were probably not truly being serious in the literal sense, but my point still stands that your line of statements is essentially hypocritical in a way. You even describe a bit of why:  > I'm pretty sure I'm entitled to having this opinion, and that it is a valid one regardless of agreement on the behalf of others.  Unless I\u2019m understanding this incorrectly, you essentially believe your opinion to be correct regardless of what others say. This is a bit dangerous especially given how I already mentioned you seem to have a bit of an issue regarding a large ego. With that in mind, individuals with the entitlement complex you mention are generally, as you say (though regarding something else), self-centered by nature. This is because they\u2019re under the belief that if they should have something they should have it no matter what (or something along those lines). Plugging in what you just said here, you believe your opinion should be considered valid no matter what.   Pretty much, there\u2019s a strong chance that you and the \u201centitled\u201d individuals you mentioned in your top-level response are very similar, as I\u2019m mentioned in some form a few times already, which is hypocrisy since by making the statement you did, you are trying to discount yourself from that group. Incidentally, \u201crudeness\u201d is another trait that has some correlation with those individuals because they have a tendency to tantrum when things don\u2019t go their way, which is what makes them supposedly so detestable.  This should hopefully answer both points 3 and (parts of) 4 and probably a good chunk of what you said after\u2026  > Also, everyone's behaviour is more validated for themselves than other people's. That's logically redundant, as I see it any way.  An understandable outlook. It is indeed true that people have a tendency to think a little more of themselves because that is the nature of ego. However, while having some semblance of a personal ego can be positive (it helps fight off low self-esteem and helps make you more determined and being more sure of yourself, etc), having too much ego, which I\u2019ve mentioned you probably have given what I said a few paragraphs ago, can lead to issues related to delusions of grandeur, superiority complexes, and otherwise believing it\u2019s okay to look down upon people.  In short, having some ego is okay. It\u2019s important to tend to your own state of mind. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to believe the state of minds of others are so inferior that they\u2019re generally not worth listening to (with exceptions) and worse, worth berating over.  > People who use that word, especially online, tend to be extremely sensitive, anxious and - worst of all - self-centered.  That seems awfully situational, though I will say that maybe the criticism to follow up on saying \u201cyou\u2019re rude and arrogant\u201d could\u2019ve been stronger to actually explain why but he (or she) does make some points. Also it\u2019s generally not that bad to be the first two traits you listed. People\u2019s sensitivities can vary a little and anxiety is a normal byproduct of various circumstances. There are some situations where either (or both) can be bad (as in getting too offended by a statement or having trouble accepting criticism because one believes it\u2019s abuse due to being too sensitive and\/or anxious and\/or even self-centered), but those are generally fringe cases that are resultant of something akin to a psychological disorder.  It\u2019s also worth pointing out that you choose to judge others as self-centered when you (based on numerous statements above), are probably also very much self-centered. I\u2019m not sure if you realize that and also, it is in a way hypocrisy (a pot calling a kettle black).  > \u2026 your final paragraph puzzled me quite a bit. \u2026  I was really more trying to make a point than anything (to be honest I had to look over your statement a few times to get a good grasp on it since my brain decided to stall). It was probably a little too ambitiously made and thus could\u2019ve been clearer, but I\u2019m still under the impression that you argue from authority and probably didn\u2019t make it too clear that it\u2019s due to believing yourself superior due to what I think is a large ego based on your statements. My question still stands as well.","target":"condescension"},{"text":"> Do you work in this industry?  What industry is that? The classification industry? lol. You're making an appeal to authority.

RAID 1 :)  There are only 2 types of hard drive - those which have failed, and those which are going to fail. \"Burning out\" of disks is irrelevant; it's the data that matters. RAID 1 means that the probability you will lose data is reduced to the probability that both drives will fail at the same time (presumably very low).  The software RAID implementation in the Linux kernel is excellent, as good as (if not better than) all but the most expensive hardware RAID controllers. You won't get much of a performance increase with a 2-disk RAID 1 solution, however. [SEP] Yes Raid1 would incrementally \"backup\" at the controller (HW or SW) level... but it's not a *backup*. Accidentally delete a file and it's gone! If you schedule a backup (hourly, for example) and run it via software you can control it - If you accidentally delete a file you can restore it from the backup file before the backup runs, you can archive backups, set policy on whether to remove files deleted from the backup etc.  This was why I was really asking about the requirements... RAID is for speed & redundancy... it's not a backup solution. With a RAID 1 your O\/s (server, whatever) will continue to run in the event of a disk failure.   OP states that it's going to be used on a desktop - redundancy is not usually an issue. If one of the disks dies and you have a backup (not RAID mirror) then you get a new disk, reinstall O\/s & copy data over - not a big deal really.  >\"Burning out\" of disks is irrelevant; it's the data that matters.  Drives wear more when under load & as such a disk that is accessed less often is less likely to fail than one which is reading \/ writing data all the time. RAID 1 - yes you'd need both the drives to fail at the same time which is not very likely, but by running both of them all the time you increase the chance that either one will fail. Again, it's a requirement of a redundant system.  With a desktop this is (usually) not an issue so you're needlessly causing extra load on a disk. OP states his 2nd disk is from an ageing server (so has probably had a hard life) - I'd take this as an issue - Running access to an old disk occasionally is not a problem but running it at full speed will reduce it's operational lifespan dramatically - I'd be happier running a daily backup to a backup disk (incremental, so not too much disk load) and running the O\/s (and live data) from a different disk.

In most cases, you're rubbing the non-believer wrong (just a little, but still being a tad impolite)... because they don't share your belief that prayer is a GOOD thing. To them, it's a waste of time, and presumptuous besides. You're basically saying, \"Oh, you lack something I have, so I'll seek supernatural intervention in order to fix you.\" Not really polite. And in worst cases, you've (unintentionally or not), just shown them how self-righteous Christians can be. Note, it doesn't matter how you meant it... if you're an atheist and have had this said to you many, many times with clear body language that it's been meant in an insulting way... another time (no matter how well-intentioned) just rubs you wrong. [Understand, this same thing happens all the time to atheists when we tell people we don't believe. That simple statement to many Christians is seen as offensive.] How would you feel if when you said, \"I'll pray for you,\" atheists responded, \"And I'll use reason for you.\" See, to an atheist, using reason is a strong value, yet the exchange (though it could be well-meant) comes across somewhat insulting doesn't it? Because it implies that YOU aren't using reason, and the atheist doing it for you might help you learn how... just like \"I'll pray for you\" to an atheist implies that he needs need God, and the believer will help him via prayer.   >They offer the statement of prayer as a profession of care and equality.  Again, the problem isn't their motives, or even their goals. If they were really being polite, they would consider the beliefs\/feelings of the person they are offering it to. Offering to pray for someone means different things to different audiences. Between believers, its a shared cultural expression offered out of love (and known to be offered that way). Between a believer and non-believer, it's not a shared cultural expression, and its often not offered out of love, but as a snide \"I'm better than you evil heathen\" type of comment. The body language and emotion in the words make that clear. Which, unfortunately can create a knee-jerk reaction. Ultimately, being polite usually means doing to someone as they wish, rather than as you wish... which in this case should be to offer the non-believer a good day (which doesn't stop you praying for them in private, but does ensure you don't insult them by presuming).  Take it as you wish, but I'm just trying to explain the other side in response to your comment, \"I've always felt that this line of thinking is offensive to the Christian.\" Hopefully you've seen why atheists CAN be insulted when being told, \"I'll pray for you.\" We have real life experience where its not meant in good ways (likely far more often than you imagine). That's one of the challenges for really kind people... they have a hard time realizing just how unthinkingly unkind most people can be.  [SEP] > they don't share your belief that prayer is a GOOD thing. To them, it's a waste of time, and presumptuous besides. You're basically saying, \"Oh, you lack something I have, so I'll seek supernatural intervention in order to fix you.\"  No, I'm saying \"I will pray for you\". The receiver may feel it's a waste of time, but it is their assumption that: I feel they lack something; I intend to fix them. If they are offended by their presumption of my statement, that is their problem.   > if you're an atheist and have had this said to you many, many times with clear body language that it's been meant in an insulting way  You're presuming body language, too. We're just talking about \"I'll pray for you\", when the pray-er is aware that the pray-ee is an atheist.  > How would you feel if when you said, \"I'll pray for you,\" atheists responded, \"And I'll use reason for you.\"  That'd be cute. I could see if it was done in a condescending body language, etc. that it could be offensive, but of course if someone is trying to offend you, then that's fait accompli. Just the words, if not snarked, are not offensive. If the atheist truly was intending that following the exchange, they would \"reason\" on behalf of another person (whatever that means), then that sounds good to me.  > Between a believer and non-believer, it's not a shared cultural expression, and its often not offered out of love, but as a snide \"I'm better than you evil heathen\" type of comment.  Sure, culturally different perspectives matter. But again, you assume that the believer is snide.  > Ultimately, being polite usually means doing to someone as they wish, rather than as you wish... which in this case should be to offer the non-believer a good day (which doesn't stop you praying for them in private, but does ensure you don't insult them by presuming).  Fair enough, I'll cede that point of polity. But for two open-minded individuals, if someone offers you something that you know is a common expression of care from their culture, and it's not common \/ polite in yours, is the polite response to accept it graciously and think \"how quaint, we don't do that where I'm from\", or is it to throw your hands up in disgust and offense?   > We have real life experience where its not meant in good ways (likely far more often than you imagine).  Again, fair enough. From one human to another, and in the sincerest expression of reason, logic, and sociologically founded principles, I wish you the opportunity to overcome prejudice and stereotype by keeping your mind open to the hope that the person you meet today is not the embodiment of the experiences of your past, even within a cultural group. This has been a core tenet of Christianity (do unto others as you would have them do unto you), and in that spirit, I will endeavor to be careful with how I express my I'll-pray-for-yous going forward.  > That's one of the challenges for really kind people... they have a hard time realizing just how unthinkingly unkind most people can be.

This doesn't go well, and is the reason why a place like \/r\/funny categorically bans political content.  Ensuring that a civil tone is upheld doesn't disallow tough criticism. The demand is simply that you present that criticism civilly. You can say that you find something disconnected from reality without characterizing anyone who holds that view illusioned morons. That is largely what politicians do, but they also overstep their bounds. It's true that emotions will get inflamed.  Requiring submissions to \/r\/politics to explicitly deal with politics is simply a limitation to ensure that content is political, not that the submitter reads something political into a situation. I could read something political into almost any news article, that doesn't make every news article political. If you can't find a current article that explicitly discusses the politics, contextualize an article that isn't explicitly political in a Saturday Self-post.  When you're in an NP tab, every subsequent tab is NP. Just like if you browse from us.reddit.com, every subsequent tab will read us.reddit.com.  \/r\/politics was a dying community after being undefaulted in July.

We were hemorrhaging users. comparing subscription rates to net subscriber growth we're now down to having around 200-400 unsubscriptions a day. Users voting with their feet are saying that \/r\/politics is improving. We had our first net gain in subscribers in a single day since the 17th of July 2013 on March 3rd. +3 subscribers.  We've got plenty more work ahead to stabilize and revitalize this forum. Users in \/r\/politics are clearly saying that this forum is moving in the right direction. [SEP] >starting a discussion based on an exaggerated\/sensationalized starting point  I understand your reasoning on why political cartoons are a bad starting point, I just think they have their place in discussions. Banning them outright seems like an overreaction.   >If you can't find a current article that explicitly discusses the politics...  Smells a lot like \"free speech zones,\" IE a ghetto where things are put to be ignored. You made an excellent point about Ptoons being a bad starting point for discussions, but I think the same logic applies here. In my experience most articles that discuss politics directly focus on the celeb\/tribal aspects of it which is explicitly not where I want the discussion to focus. Saying you can break the rule on Saturdays simply says we will have bad starting points most of the time and sounds like a condescending nod to vanity and narcissism. I'll just say I'm still not convinced this is a good policy yet.   >When you're in an NP tab, every subsequent tab is NP.   Thanks for this explanation, but am I wrong in my understanding that xpost links get this prefix? If not I still think that is a poor way to present the sub to the uninitiated.

Does telling them overtly that we don't value their contributions encourage them to stay?  >Users in \/r\/politics are clearly saying that this forum is moving in the right direction.  Weeeeellllll, not so sure about that. We may have fewer leaving subscribers but if people are still net leaving it means they are still unhappy. Further, it seems the majority of the comments with a lot of upvotes in this discussion are critical of the moderation on the board, with a stolid consensus seeming to believe it's too rules heavy (although there seems to be a vocal minority opinion that the majority are muzzling conservative comments and want more moderation to deal with it). Overall, I think the sub would benefit from a more light-touched approach then the current guidelines imply. Perhaps consider a bit of benign neglect.   >\/r\/politics was a dying community after being undefaulted in July  I personally wonder what is going on with the choice of default subreddits.

I realize haven't been well mentally in a very long time, never had much of a family or many friends, my dad didn't want me and left, lots of stupid and sad stuff, etc. It became worse when I moved probably over a thousand miles from everyone I ever knew after losing my home, job\/business and means to going to college.   After moving to this new area, I've been basically in seclusion for 9 years now while honing my craft and making money from it. I developed online friendships and became attached to these people more than any real friends or family I ever had. It was easier to be myself and have no regrets. I didn't get embarrassed by people anymore, or have people try and pick fights with me, I changed from a violent person to someone who just wanted to be left alone. I was at peace for a short while, but still very lonely.   A few years ago, I developed feelings for someone online who wanted me as a partner after talking for a few years, they were aggressive in a way and lobbied for us to be together. I never had someone go after me in a way, but this person was everything I wanted in a SO, we had a bond that we both never had before with anyone else. This other person wasn't exactly in good health mentally as well and faced their own demons, but we cared about each other deeply, we both just wanted someone to accept us for who we were unconditionally, someone to love us.   After falling on hard times this year, they were there for me as anyone could be living 2000 miles away. My health started going south and I could no longer work until I got well. During this period, our plans to meet fell apart, and so did the person's feelings for me apparently, they thought I maybe took them for granted, when this person was on my mind 24 hours a day. Maybe I didn't do enough, it's all that clouds my mind now, any declarations of feelings or gifts from the heart are met with being completely ignored nowadays.  Now I'm in a complete downward spiral. I have panic attacks every day, multiple ones every few hours, it drives me to the brink of tears and I don't know what to do. All I can think about are all the people who have abandoned me in my life and how I'm not worth loving or being cared about, when I tried to show them otherwise. I've been around to listen to anyone's problems and help them in most any way, but as I feel this way I find no one is there or will make time for me. I feel used, unappreciated, and thrown away. Most of all I'm tired of being in pain every day. People can only take so much, I thought I could ride out my years on earth until I achieved some form of happiness through hard work. But now all I want is my pain to end. I'm not the best person, I wanted to be happy for once in my life.   If you're with your family and friends and have a good or even \"decent\" relationship with them, please don't take it for granted. These people will help shape your life, and it won't always be good, but it will help you in the long run be a better and happier person. I can only speak from the experience of not having that most of my life. All I can do is leave that for anyone who thinks they have no one to turn to.  And if you truly don't? At least know there are others who know and share that pain. That might not be enough though, as it isn't for me. [SEP] >  I'm not the best person, I wanted to be happy for once in my life.

Building up to the election like this can have huge consequences for the US as a whole, regardless of what she did or did not do. Couple that with nothing on Trump, and it looks off.    **The responsible thing would be to release it as far advanced to the elections as possible so the US people can actually discuss it rather than have a knee jerk reaction. **   Edit: I can't respond to everyone, but I've gotten a lot of similar comments.    1. I emboldened the part where I'm clearly okay with leaking information. It's the timing that I don't like, and one sidedness that doesn't seem right. I understand that having something on Clinton does not guarantee there is something on the RNC\/Trump, but it definitely seems one sided.     2. \"He's doing not because people forget quickly! Clinton deserves this! The American people need to wake up!\" I don't think the ends justify the means in this, and that the US people aren't as dumb (or you aren't as smart) as you make them out to be. The irony here is that Trump is not escaping over time, and if Clinton did something truest horrible I'm pretty confident she'd be treated the same.     3. \"The news media is obviously controlled by Clinton!\" Unless you think the evangelical church, Mormon church, Glenn Beck, RNC and many conservative news companies are also colluding with them, then Trump is probably as worthy of this attention as it gets. I'm very concerned with him promoting the idea that the election is rigged, as it will probably lead to his followers taking more drastic measures. He's a sore loser that does not consider the outcome of his actions.    4. \"Everything about Trump is already public, so there's nothing to leak\" There's still the details of the many sexual harassment cases against his company, information on Trump U, his charity, private business dealings, more tax returns, details of his rape allegation from his x wife that was retracted as a part of their divorce settlement, etc. There's substantially more to expect from Trump than Clinton.   5. \"You're a cuck for Clinton!\" We get it, you go to 4chan.    6. \"Clinton is a criminal!\" Please provide a reputable source for this.

But, get this, philosophers who don't have problems with basic concepts actually do accept that definition.  I responded to your claim that - \"The definition for atheism as is used by philosophers is pretty much the same as \"we\" do over here.\"   This is a debate, just as you shouldn't be expected to accept my opinion without supporting evidence, I shouldn't be expected to accept your assertion that philosophers use the lacking belief definition without some evidence to support it.   And the evidence you supplied in your last post - a link to an IEP article - rather than supporting your claim, shows you're wrong about this. To quote from the article -  >\"It has come to be widely accepted that to be an atheist is to affirm the non-existence of God.\"   They specifically say \"it has come to be widely accepted\". The IEP does then mention the lacking belief as negative atheism, but only to specifically distinguish it from the positive atheism definition they will use.   Here is the definition they use -  >Atheism is the view that there is no God.   So philosophers don't use the same definition we use here.  >Those are what appear to be the reasoning [ignoring what they don't want to hear, or scaring people into submission]   It may appear that way to you, but sometimes what initially appears to us to be true, turns out to be based on a misunderstanding. They are not the reasons philosophers would reject it.   >Even in the post you linked, the person cites sources that define atheism as the lack of belief in a god or gods to \"support\" their argument, Clearly that person is ignoring\/dismissing the parts of the definition that they do not like.  No they're not. They're supporting their point that lacking belief isn't widely accepted and isn't the definition philosophers use. They say - \" [IEP] explicitly notes the distinction between this so-called \"positive atheism\" and the broader \"negative atheism\" so as to clearly note that the sense which is widely accepted and which they will use is the narrower \"positive atheism\"    >If someone says that the term \"atheist\" meaning \"one who does not believe in a god or gods\" is too confusing for them,   The objection isn't that \"people\" are confused by the definition, it's that the definition \"confuses the issues\".   >For instance, if they think that atheist is too confusing because it contains within it, two possible positions (one who believes that there are no gods and one who lacks a belief in a god or gods),   This isn't the objection though. The two possible positions it confuses are atheism and agnosticism. Using the lack of belief definition means it's not possible to distinguish between them. It also necessitates eliminating agnostic as a distinct position. Because agnostics lack belief in God they're now called atheists. But this isn't an accurate description of their position because they also lack belief in no-God. Since agnostic is a substantial and important position on the question, this feature makes the definitions unacceptable.    >So yeah, they ignore the bits that don't support their ignorant narrative, and then pretend that it's philosophy instead of just plain and simple dishonesty.  You're being very uncharitable in your reading of that post and to the opposing view generally. It's quite insulting to call someone you disagree with dishonest and ignorant. They didn't ignore bit's that don't support their view. They were responding to particular myths and addressing them directly.   They were rebutting claims made by some atheists that this lacking belief definition is the only correct definition. The title specifically says - \"First myth - \"That 'atheism' refers to the absence of a belief that God exists is just the correct definition of the word, as anyone who studies the issue would know..\"  Maybe consider the possibility you could be mistaken about this and read the post with that in mind.

To quote from the article -  That's a good joke, made me audibly laugh.  It's funny that you skipped over the first sentence in the article:  >The term \u201catheist\u201d describes a person who does not believe that God or a divine being exists.   And the next paragraph...  >And they have argued that the evidence in favor of God\u2019s existence is too weak, or the arguments in favor of concluding there is no God are more compelling.  And some other sentences:  >There have been many thinkers in history who have lacked a belief in God.  >So negative atheism would includes someone who has never reflected on the question of whether or not God exists and has no opinion about the matter and someone who had thought about the matter a great deal and has concluded either that she has insufficient evidence to decide the question, or that the question cannot be resolved in principle.  And...  >Atheism can be narrow or wide in scope. The narrow atheist does not believe in the existence of God (an omni- being). A wide atheist does not believe that any gods exist, including but not limited to the traditional omni-God. The wide positive atheist denies that God exists, and also denies that Zeus, Gefjun, Thor, Sobek, Bakunawa and others exist. The narrow atheist does not believe that God exists, but need not take a stronger view about the existence or non-existence of other supernatural beings.  Ah, why even bother? You're just going to once again ignore the parts that you disagree with.  I will though say that I disagree in many parts of that article. And many others. Like this one:  >Agnosticism is traditionally characterized as neither believing that God exists nor believing that God does not exist.  What then is gnosticism? Knowing that there is a god and that there isn't a god? Talk about confusing the issue. That term doesn't even make sense with that definition. I am learning that for many a self-claimed philosopher, that word definitions don't matter as long as they can inanely banter on for many pages of of text. It seems that thinking, learning and developing thoughts has been replaced by trying to overwhelm people with verbiage until they submit. Using a lot of words to say almost nothing.  >The IEP does then mention the lacking belief as negative atheism, but only to specifically distinguish it from the positive atheism definition they will use.   Not just then, in many other parts as well. I suggest you read the whole thing. Check out near the end:  >20th century developments in epistemology, philosophy of science, logic, and philosophy of language indicate that many of the presumptions that supported old fashioned natural theology and atheology are mistaken.  Things are changing, philosophers use the same definition I use, not all of them, but then I'm not making the mistake of generalizing all philosophers.  >Here is the definition they use -  One of them. Once again, you seemed to have missed the other ones.  >So philosophers don't use the same definition we use here.  I await your evidence to support your claim. I have provided some evidence, nearly every definition of the term atheist supports me, and there are a number of philosophers that do as well.  Bertrand Russel:  >There is exactly the same degree of possibility and likelihood of the existence of the Christian God as there is of the existence of the Homeric God. I cannot prove that either the Christian God or the Homeric gods do not exist, but I do not think that their existence is an alternative that is sufficiently probable to be worth serious consideration. Therefore, I suppose that that on these documents that they submit to me on these occasions I ought to say \"Atheist\", although it has been a very difficult problem, and sometimes I have said one and sometimes the other without any clear principle by which to go.  Though it is true that he also described it as the other, the point is that philosophers do also use the same definition I do. There is a whole list of atheist philosophers that use the same definition I do, but I do not currently have the time to go in an find all the citations. Dennett is one, Harris another (even though I have many an issue with Harris).  >It may appear that way to you, but sometimes what initially appears to us to be true, turns out to be based on a misunderstanding. They are not the reasons philosophers would reject it.   It's not what initially appears to be, it's what it eventually looks like, Try not to make unfounded assumptions.  >No they're not.  Yes they are. As I originally stated. Here is a link from the post you linked to:  >\"\u2018Atheism\u2019 means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God.\"  Again, try to read both what I'm saying and at least what you link to. If you expect me to read through all that meaningless drivel, you could at least do the same. Did you read the thing you linked me?  >In our understanding, the argument for this broader notion was introduced into the philosophical literature by Antony Flew[...]  Hrm, a philosopher using that definition... just like I argued. Yeah, some of the older guys were resistant to the change, but that's not uncommon in philosophy. Things change in philosophy, and currently there are philosophers that use the definition \"non-philosophers\" use.  >The objection isn't that \"people\" are confused by the definition, it's that the definition \"confuses the issues\"  What issues?  >This isn't the objection though. This isn't the objection though. The two possible positions it confuses are atheism and agnosticism. Using the lack of belief definition means it's not possible to distinguish between them.  Oh noes, whatever shall we do? I guess language better never change to adapt to the zeitgeist! Because we can't lose these precious words! Even if modern philosophy hadn't already adapted the language, I don't mourn the loss of a term, so many have gone by the wayside over the centuries.  >Since agnostic is a substantial and important position on the question, this feature makes the definitions unacceptable.   Subjective, I don't agree that it's important at all, but go ahead and I'll listen to why you think it's important. But I very likely have already heard similar justifications to what you are likely to come up with.  >You're being very uncharitable in your reading of that post and to the opposing view generally.  That is a false statement. You cannot tell how charitable I am being with my conclusions. I have spent many a year dealing with it.  >They were responding to particular myths and addressing them directly.  The \"myths\" are myths themselves. Take the first one, worded as it is, it's not something that is common at all. Like many others who object to the same kind of argument, we can see the term having more than one meaning, not many argue that the only definition is the \"lack of belief.\" But I'm sure, like anything else on the internet, you can find a few people that say otherwise.  >They were rebutting claims made by some atheists that this lacking belief definition is the only correct definition.  How charitable to address a minority, or in other words: either a straw man or a faulty generalization.  >Maybe consider the possibility you could be mistaken about this and read the post with that in mind.

Unfortunately, it seems to be turning that way.

You were expected to show progress on something, but you could do it on your own terms. Programming was more like an R&D job than today's ticket-shop nonsense.

Ugh. The condescending hand on the shoulder makes it the worst. It's a power move. People just shouldn't touch each other at work. I would at least tell him to stop touching me (and pursue legal action if he kept doing it).  Product managers are another dystopian element of technology that, as it became more standard, convinced me that this industry was winding down, at least from a high-talent perspective. Executives (MBAs, mostly) have such a low opinion of their ex-engineer middle management that they've had to build a parallel management structure.  Your bosses probably hate PMs as much as you do. Even though the people manager has more power on paper, and product managers are generally disliked by everyone, they still get promoted faster. It ends up turning into a male-work\/female-work split where the PM gets the male work (\"delivering\" to executards what they want) and the people manager gets the female work (resolving conflicts, handling issues no one wants to deal with) and so it's not surprising that the PMs move up faster.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"Few thoughts:   Picture 1: Conduct doesn't mean what you think it means.

These are facts, they aren't my \"feminist opinion\", yet it will be treated as such, and that's part of the problem.  [SEP] There has been problems with rape before in militaries. It's not a new thing by any stretch of the imagination.  There's a big wide world outside the US and just because female harassment in the US military is an issue now doesn't mean male and female rape hasn't been a real problem in other places before.  Specifically in my country when I served most of the stories I heard about rape involved a Sergeant Major buggering young privates in the 80\/90's. He was eventually court martialed over it (found him in the back of the paper one morning as a footnote), no one took much interest in it. Somewhat understandable, I'd imagine the victims just wanted to get on with their lives.  He raped numerous young privates who were in no position of authority to do much about it. The young men he raped were nicknamed 'delboys' he was that well known, no idea why. EVERYONE in the forces seemed to know about it. He just became a cautionary tale I guess, didn't stick around long enough to find out how the fuck it managed to happen to be honest.  Secondly, people take allegations of rape seriously. Perhaps YOUR country in your anecdotal experience or cherry picked cases may not, but others do and have.  If you think rape is tantamount in value to just being a \"war prize\" or \"relief\" when it involves men, you're painfully fucking naive, sorry but you need to research the subject more is all I can say.   I'd strongly look at the psychology of rape in the prison system and gangland, in both the UK and the US. Then if you have some time left over, please check out the rape of young boys by the Catholic church and the absolute disgrace of those issues. Then of course you can look into other religious cults etc.  The reason most people tend to \"shout down\" feminist opinions is that they typically have to belittle other issues (usually male ones) so they can make their issue seem more important.

The poor person might get compensated fairly quickly for an injustice done to them and the prosecutor would have an incentive to get as much restitution as he could, thus punishing the perpetrator.

How could ancapism abolish nations or nationality permanently? Also, wars existed long before states and nationalism. Tribal warfare was one of the leading causes of pre-agricultural death. That's anthropology 101.  I'm not gonna bother with the rest, I don't care and I can't change your mind most likely, but I'll address this.  >you just have implicit bias against ancaps.  Yes. There is no feasible long-term way of not having a state as long as capitalism exists. Disputes of property must be settled by some sort of power with access to violence.   If you can't accept a state must exist to arbitrate disputes and protect private property, then I cannot debate with you because denying that fact and trying to explain how everything wouldn't be absolutely awful without long extremely complex explanations on how people would always behave in certain situations that don't necessitate a state simply has a level of understanding of how societies and people function that I can't breach. If you can accept the necessity of a state then discussion is possible because you have some sort of understanding of reality and how people function. I can't tell if ancaps simply don't know enough history or sociology or anthropology or any combination of those, but they just don't know what they're talking about and they must realize it on their own. Is that demeaning and condescending? Yeah. Can the same be said by others of communist positions? Definitely.   For instance, your post simply lacks an understanding of what parents do and what people have done in history. Not all parents particularly care about their kids future. For most of history, children were born to be farmhands. Parents in poverty want their kids to work ASAP to add income to the household. It's not because they're bad, it's because they need money. That's not an opinion, that's fact. When Mexican immigrants take their kids out of free school to go pick strawberries, they're doing so because they have to.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"Prices will correct themselves.

If we go by what you're arguing, however, then technically TASM2 only has 2 as well -- Electro and Harry, mostly because Rhino doesn't add anything substantial nor take away anything. He's simply there to give Spidey a good introduction at the start of the film and give Spidey closure at the end of the film with embracing being a hero once more. Hardly distracts the film in my eyes.   Electro was marketed as the main villain, but the marketing also made the film out to be this battle royale that saw Spidey vs. a trio that would help comprise the Sinister Six. If we take the film's true intentions at face value, however, it could also be argued this was Harry Osborn's story more than anything. Electro could be seen as the environmental villain with Harry being the true villain when all is said and done. After all, he's the one who ended up hurting Peter the most and the working title of TASM2 was originally \"Sins of the Father\", connecting Peter and Harry by the ways of their deceased Dads.  > His motivations to hate Spider-Man were purely out of rage, but even then it's stupid how he suddenly turns on Spider-Man.    You argue they were stupid where I argue they were very simplistic. Thin, sure, but easy to get. Max Dillon as a character was established as a loner and a nobody (also a bit off). Nobody would care if Max fell off the face of the Earth. He got the recognition he wanted from Spider-Man the moment he was saved from the taxi and became enamored with him because it was the first time anyone really took notice of him in more than a condescending\/useless way because Spidey specifically referred to him as \"His Guy\".   When he becomes Electro, he becomes noticed by news networks, people in Times Square and is on the jumbo tron. He finally has what he wants..until Spider-Man shows up and in Max's twisted psyche he believes Spider-Man was just using him, hence why he calls him selfish before he loses his mind and almost turns Times Square into a warzone.   >Harry's is stupid as well. His dad dies at an old age, and Harry is like what, 20? He could wait and take time to find a cure.   Of course he could've, but the keyword in it is dying and he was desperate. He specifically tells Peter when he begs him to get Spidey to help him that he doesn't want to end up like his Dad, who suffered an unknown amount of time before dying a miserable death. Why wait? Anyone who is suddenly dying wants to stop it right then and there, no matter how much time they may have.

Joe Flacco has the worst stat line out of any franchise QB in the league. He was good for 4 games, and then rode Kubes to a solid season, but has never come anywhere close to that. He's not good.

Christian anarchism doesn't deny the Bible as a whole, although it does discredit several of the books of the Bible. Even if you do believe in the Bible, everything it says is up for interpretation. Creationism is not a fundamental concept of Christianity. Creationism is a literal interpretation of the creation story stated in Genesis, and even miniscule study of the Bible reveals that its books rarely speak literally. As I'm sure you know, the book of Genesis was not written by God and the same is true for the whole Bible. If you didn\u2019t know that, you can look into that yourself, but to get back on topic, the book of Genesis was written by Moses with knowledge and eyewitness testimony passed down by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Enoch, Isaac, and Jacob.

But when it's presented as feminists are the cause for the empathy gap it's a different statement altogether than just asking for acknowledgement that one exists. This is what I was initially talking about with regards to being anti something instead of just critical of it. When you're against something as broad as feminism (and to a lesser extent the MRM) everything is looked at in how something is wrong relative to that movement.   So let's assume for arguments sake that feminists don't acknowledge an empathy gap. We should now ask ourselves why it's important that the narrative be that \"feminists don't\" instead of \"society ought to\"? Or perhaps asked a different way would be to ask why it is that feminists not acknowledging it is the fundamentally important part of addressing the issue? And to add to this, while it may very well be something that feminists haven't actually addressed or recognized, there's a level of malicious intent that's assigned to them in many instances, and I think that's a step too far. It's entirely conceivable that they are ignorant of it because they're focusing on other things.   To put this in perspective, there's plenty of things that I can potentially feel empathy for, but if I'm put into a position where someone says that I lack empathy for an issue that I didn't realize was a problem it would put me on the defensive very quickly because it's accusing me of being a horrible person. Who wouldn't, in that circumstance, not agree with someone? I'd assume most people.  [SEP] > So let's assume for arguments sake that feminists don't acknowledge an empathy gap. We should now ask ourselves why it's important that the narrative be that \"feminists don't\" instead of \"society ought to\"? Or perhaps asked a different way would be to ask why it is that feminists not acknowledging it is the fundamentally important part of addressing the issue?  This is actually trivially easy to answer. In at least the realm of gender politics Feminists and Traditionalists hold the most power.   Traditionalists want to go back to when there was even less care for men as individuals and where women as a group might have had more empathy at time it was an impersonal and condescending type of empathy. So trying to get these people to accept the empathy gap would be futile, even if they accepted it likely they would think it acceptable or unalterable.   Feminists on the other hand are ostensibly about caring about equality and while I do not think this is universally true of every feminist I do think it might be possible to reason with some and perhaps shame others into accepting this.  The vast majority of people do not have the voice to matter so while it would be great to convince the mass of voiceless people if we can convince those who already have a voice in gender politics they can convince far more people than we alone could. And to be honest even if we can only get Feminists to rail against the idea it's getting more people aware of the issue than would have known about it before.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":">Look how Russia's life expectancy decreased as their \"wealth\" increased thanks to capitalism and foreign investment.

The government should be there to balance the interest of people who making money from the tourists and those who don't and those you're directly affected by it, i.e. enforcing strict zoning rules, parking rules, crack down on parallel importers, whatever.   But they don't.  >But that's not saying we cannot adapt and MINIMIZE this inconvenience as Singapore proved (focus on high-yield mainland tourists who also happens to be those who don't go around shitting in streets).  I don't see you holding our government accountable to that.   Aside from a few government official lamely gesturing they might do something after the last blowup, the only party that is currently proposing a border tax to stop the flood of parallel importers and focus on the high-yield tourist is People Power - yup, the bunch of extremists you don't like.   A tax is fairer than a quota if you ask me. Pity I don't see any better proposals from the business minds like the Liberal Party or Regina.  >You also don't see Singaporeans complaining because they're not whining bitches and they actually deal with their problems by adapting to them instead of attacking tourists. You know, like how we USED to do.  I don't like the attack on the tourists either, but I blame the government more for letting the situation fester for this many years. The first anti-locust rally is at least 3, 4 years ago in Sheung Shui, there was plenty of time to for them to research, respond and adapt, yet they did nothing.  If we're talking about Singapore anyway. At least, they have good public housing system. People don't have to live in subdivided housing while mainland investors leave their investment properties empty for years. Furthermore, the Singapore government loves to bribe people with their housing and certainly won't be devoting ONLY 6% of the land to public housing in what would be their biggest development project for the next 20 years like the HKSAR gov't is currently proposing.  >I DO prefer the mom-and-pop stores in residential malls over outlets, but I'm not going to go around attacking mainland tourists over it. That's something you support when you defend Long Hair and pan-dem extremists like him.  There is no avenue in the current government system to enforce this preference. The government is doing a shit job even enforcing rules that would help save mom-and-pop store in properties that they OWN, thanks to \u9818\u6ed9 and the free-market idiots crafting these policies.   As much as you hate Long Hair, he is both a product and a symptom of the dysfunctionality of the system. I would say the same about CY.

It's abhorrent for people to focus their energy on attacking those who are successful for having \"too much money\" when there are more pressing problems, like how to pump up the lower and middle classes by giving them more quality education and working experience, and working experience usually comes through minimum wage jobs. It's false to say many are stuck working close to it, when again, about 99% of people who work full time aren't working minimum wage. Health insurance is a different issue, and you are completely correct it is shameful. More competition in the free market brings down prices in services and goods, like healthcare. More competition in the labor market drives up labor price for companies, so giving people the OPPORTUNITY for experience and education is how you increase the competition in the labor market, which would drive up wages. And how do you get more experience? Working more. And how do you expect young people to get ahead, get experience, and to work more when 600,000 teen jobs were cut last time we raised the minimum wage.

Hell, I want to believe that hard work leads to success and that we live in a meritocracy. We don't. Wealth inequality is the result of systems and laws designed to help the privileged. I used to lean right back when I was your age, but then I realized these were mostly systemic issues and not individual issues.  \"Freedom\" just means more freedom for those with capital to tilt the playing field.

But, I didn't know what all the edit titles meant and where to do what I needed. They should do a tutorial like they do for MyClub.

If you owned a business, wanting to expand, and your only competitor was losing longtime customers, you wouldn't want those customers, their money, and word of mouth advertising? That's business 101 and what Konami needs to take advantage of right now.   I mainly don't care about licenses and menu navigation, but I do care about the time and effort put into the game and THIS SEASONS rosters because I don't want to invest in a game mode that'll be irrelevant as soon these updates are made. NBA 2K16 will be out next week and ideally PES would've wanted their American customers dividing gameplay and wanting to buy next years game too. Instead, because I'm not immersed in any game mode, I'll switch over to NBA, and likely buy FIFA yet again.   My point about working in Marketing was just that I'm not some FIFA fanboy that doesn't have any idea on how to build a fan base in the largest market in the world, a.k.a marketing. No offense, but you sound like the same American soccer fans that don't want the average sports fan to like soccer. As a big PES fan, which I can only assume you are, you should be rooting for PES to be more competitive in every aspect because it would create more customers, thus deeper pockets for them to invest into the game.  [SEP] >They should do a tutorial like they do for MyClub  Most people don't want that. They have a guide online.  >That's business 101 and what Konami needs to take advantage of right now.  You're right, it is business 101, in that there are dozens of factors you aren't even considering.  Konami has said that their focus is gameplay. Even if they had billions of dollars to spend on it, they still legally couldn't get licenses.   When I said that you aren't their target audience, I meant it. Right this second, there are two options in front of you: a game with complacent developers focusing only on one gamemode because it's popular, or a game that focuses on the flaws of the competitors.  We all wish that PES had the same level of presentation as FIFA, but the fact is that it doesn't, and that isn't a priority (nor should it be).  This sub has grown 100% since last year's release. I know, that's only a thousand, it's pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things, etc etc, but I think it's one sign that what Konami is doing is attracting an audience. That's what their goal is.  >No offense, but you sound like the same American soccer fans that don't want the average sports fan to like soccer  I don't know what American soccer fans you've been talking to; I told you to buy FIFA, I couldn't give a shit how much you like the sport.   >As a big PES fan, which I can only assume you are, you should be rooting for PES to be more competitive in every aspect because it would create more customers, thus deeper pockets for them to invest into the game.  Yeah, and how are they supposed to do that if people like you buy the game, play it for a week, then dismiss it because the roster update was a little late?

They teeter on a line of thinking that I'd be better off without them and have had recent self-harm nights so I don't think that would be in my best interest of making them feel loved and keeping them safe and stable.   > Your SO needs to know that it's not them specifically that's causing you to feel this way, but their unwillingness to help you help them.  I think this is something I'll be focusing on with them, I am worried I'll be accused of being \"manipulative\" if I say \"hey this makes me feel really anxious if you don't get meds or go to therapy\" because that has been a response I've gotten before.  But maybe it's all in the way I say it, and usually it's over texting which can be rife with misunderstandings.  What's interesting about the patient\/carer dynamic is that they have criticized me for acting like their parent\/therapist. And that I \"baby\" them too much. So it's obvious that I find myself falling into this role, which bothers them. Though they do say that they love it when I \"take care of them\" and \"spoil them\" when they feel depressed, but they hate it when I do the same thing when they're manic or I guess fairly middle-ground as well.  I'll be the first to admit, a lot of the things and apprehensions I have against bringing negative thoughts from me to them is my own anxieties on the matter. Early on in the relationship I was not able to communicate those dark parts of me well and they were very unattached and distant because of it. There was some... infidelity-ish things going on and drug abuse at that time as well. But honestly I don't think they remember most of that half of the year, it was a really intense episode.  I actually talked to them last night about how stressed I feel about being tired and sad all the time, and feeling guilty for even going to therapy or considering looking for medication. I told them I wondered if I had Borderline-PD or ADHD \/ anxiety or depression and that I feel shitty a lot but it's not because of them.  And they re-assured me that they want me to come to them about this stuff as much as possible. In the last... almost a year in our relationship they have really 180'd and became such a better partner and I can tell they love me now. I'm extremely content with them.  But I guess I still am terrified of it suddenly snapping back to the time where they told me things like \"I wish you didn't even like me so I could kill myself and not feel guilty about it\" almost every day.   Anyway. I might have painted a picture of them like some kind of monster, but they are literally the sunshine of my life and I don't know what I'd do without them. They are a truly amazing person and so dear to me.   I think sometimes I feel over-attached and worry too much [SEP] >I'm just really terrified that someone who is un-medicated and really unstable\/suicidal really can't take those kind of harsh critical words.  Is telling them how you honestly feel \"harsh\" and \"critical\"? This isn't usual behaviour in a relationship. You should honestly consider if it's fair that your amount of honesty is limited to how much truth your SO can tolerate about how their behaviour affects others.  >I am worried I'll be accused of being \"manipulative\" if I say \"hey this makes me feel really anxious if you don't get meds or go to therapy\" because that has been a response I've gotten before.  I wonder why you worry about being called manipulative for expressing that someone's self-destructive behaviour affects you too, whereas you've said before that you can't even express when you've had a bad day because it'll make your SO feel even worse about themselves. This seems like a huge power imbalance in the relationship. I'm not suggesting this is something you bring up with them, but just something to think about on your end.  >But maybe it's all in the way I say it, and usually it's over texting which can be rife with misunderstandings.  I doubt it's so much what you say as the means through which it's being conveyed. Texting is the worst for having these kind of conversation because so much emotional context gets left out and everything comes across as flat and neutral. I'd recommend having a conversation over the phone\/Skype\/face to face for this reason, so that you can explain yourself in more detail, and even if you are saying things which your SO perceives as critical, your tone and demeanour will at least indicate that you're caring and supportive.  >What's interesting about the patient\/carer dynamic is that they have criticized me for acting like their parent\/therapist.  You literally cannot win in this scenario. They continually pull the rug out from under themselves, expect someone else to clean up the mess, then criticise you for doing so. No wonder you're exhausted and anxious all the time. You're being pushed into someone else's crisis state, then being made to feel awful for doing that when in fact, it was the right thing to do at that time.  >Though they do say that they love it when I \"take care of them\" and \"spoil them\" when they feel depressed, but they hate it when I do the same thing when they're manic or I guess fairly middle-ground as well.  It seems like your SO appreciates you creating a holding environment when they're depressed but resents you for doing it at other times. To that, I'd say that this is indicative of your SO not effectively setting boundaries and 'rules' for what they feel comfortable with. Not to mention that welcoming help when depressed but rejecting it when the opposite happens sends a conflicted message, despite being just as vulnerable in both situations. I'd recommend speaking to your SO to figure out between you what is the best thing you both can do in both states, in a way that works for both of your mental health.  >I actually talked to them last night about how stressed I feel about being tired and sad all the time, and feeling guilty for even going to therapy or considering looking for medication. I told them I wondered if I had Borderline-PD or ADHD \/ anxiety or depression and that I feel shitty a lot but it's not because of them. And they re-assured me that they want me to come to them about this stuff as much as possible.  This is a really positive step, so well done! You should be proud of yourself for biting the bullet and allowing yourself to be vulnerable with your SO. As expected, your partner does want to support you when you're feeling low, which is a great basis for further interaction in getting stuff off your chest. But I'd lie if I didn't also have some reservations about this. Your partner is telling the truth here about wanting to support you but has also engineered a situation where they can only do so on their terms or when it's favourable for them (unconsciously, I think). Are you really able to open up to them unconditionally (as any successful couple should) if it's conditional on your SO not being in a 'worse' state? Just something to think about.  >But I guess I still am terrified of it suddenly snapping back to the time where they told me things like \"I wish you didn't even like me so I could kill myself and not feel guilty about it\" almost every day.  I'm not gonna lie, there is the possibility of this happening if your SO continues to refuse to get treatment. Because people with bipolar are thinking this everyday, it becomes normalised for them and to some extent, their SOs. I say this as someone with bipolar though - this attitude is absolutely not healthy, not for your SO, not for you. They're essentially seeking permission to kill themselves, but it also creates a situation where, if you were to stop liking them, you would feel responsible for them committing suicide. That's not okay to put on anyone else, let alone your life and spiritual partner. I know this is a past attitude, but you seem to have a real fear of this resurfacing.  >Anyway. I might have painted a picture of them like some kind of monster, but they are literally the sunshine of my life and I don't know what I'd do without them. They are a truly amazing person and so dear to me.  Oh, absolutely. Bipolar SOs can be the most challenging, infuriating, and upsetting people you will ever meet, but we balance that out by being some of the most special and loveable people on Earth. I know it's not all bad in your relationship - after all, you're not here because of positive reasons and we're only here to listen\/advise about what to do for the bad parts. I have no doubt your SO is a pretty amazing person and there is a lot of mutual love, but all the problems I've mentioned are inhibiting you from being a completely happy and healthy relationship.  It might sound condescending but you should take a minute to breathe and pat yourself on the back for being emotionally honest with your SO. It's not easy to do even when both people in the relationship are mentally healthy; the fact that you both experience mental health problems complicates this tenfold. It's positive that your SO has changed drastically once before to support you, so I believe they can do it again. It just takes a lot of willpower on their part to look at the ugliest parts of themselves, but that's not easy when you're severely depressed. In the meantime, be light and positive toward yourself - focus on the things you are successful at in the day rather than what you couldn't do. I honestly believe you two can work this out, but you have to be kind to yourself first.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"At my time of comment it had no downvotes.

Those who do that, seem to just decide that others are not using logical ordering themselves.  That's a difficult one to argue. I doubt JR's apparent certainty that he saw a fire on the Monday, mainly because of evidence from other reports that cast doubt on their impartiality. It also doesn't seen to add up to me, that he distinctly recalls a large fire on the Monday at 4:30pm, yet all the other initial witnesses, who were only meters away, make no mention of any fire. Now I would argue, that approach is rational and based on the evidence. However, because I believe Avery is innocent, my approach is considered proof of confirmation bias, therefore of no merit whatsoever, unless I changed my opinion to conclude there was a fire and that Avery is guilty. Do you see my problem?   >I am clearly following an order and evaluating all data points. I have been very clear with you as to why I show lower confidence in certain data points and therefore apply less weight.  Like you, somethings I will give more weight to than others, although I don't consider any \"data points\" in isolation, but will attempt to see where they fit into the bigger picture, thereby allowing me to be a bit more precise as to what importance I might give them.  >You seem to have a whole different set of weight that you place on someone giving two different accounts of the same time\/event. Confirmation bias can get you there imo.  With regard to two different accounts, I would generally accept someone first account as being the most reliable.  >You also want me to accept that Avery simply accepted there was a fire because everyone else said so. Fair to say that. However, I think the opposing argument of him admitting it, because others noticed it, is possibly more likely.  That argument is again based on the fact there WAS a fire on the Monday, which if you accept that, I would agree he might have had to admit there was one, because others noticed it. It what you don't seem to have considered, was what if there WASN'T a fire on the Monday. How does that all all fit? Initially, the only suggestion there was, is JR's account. It wasn't recorded, nor do we know when the report was actually written. You seem to have placed all your faith in that one report, to conclude there was a fire, even though we have at least seven people who initially make no mention of a fire. So why do you give 100% credit to one account, but 0% credit to seven accounts? If you did consider there was no fire Monday, then what would Steve and Brendan have done? Exactly, not mention a fire.  >What you don't see is me at times arguing YOUR side of the equation. Why do I do this? Because I am ok with questioning my own beliefs and I'm not trying to confirm a bias, but rather just evaluate the probability of either side. I make no conclusion.   Not strictly true. You conclude there was a fire Monday, therefore conclude Avery and Dassey intentionally concealed that fact, to give one example.   >You on the other hand? you've made a conclusion and are trying to change a mind that is not made up, but just plainly is playing devils advocate to yours.  This is not going well, as I disagree with you again! I made an argument that Dassey hadn't been coached, based in part from information that was know, but you concluded he had been. That's not playing devil's advocate as I see it. You could certainly express why you don't think he was coached, that would be playing devil's, but when you conclude he wasn't, that is just an opinion, the same as my opinion that he wasn't.   >I see both what you are saying and what I am saying as still possible. I am also defining what I 'd like to know to get closer to raising\/lowering probability of either side. I told you that I am open to actual evidence that JR might have a reason to lie etc. But you just saying \"maybe\", isn't pushing the needle. I hope you can understand. I'm even acknowledging he could have misremembered, but I'm not going to just assume that as you do, to confirm a bias. -- yes, I trust him more than the rest of the cast, because I haven't seen him make contradicting statements. For instance -- if it was shown that he couldn't possibly see avery's fire from the road to the deer camp, I'd be skeptical of him as it would now be a untruth. right?  I see the JR issue as far more narrow than you do. I don't know what he actually said, any more than you do, so all with have is a report that we should put our faith in. We can both accept the report as 100% correct, with the one minor exception on my part, as to whether the fire was on the Monday. As I said in the other post, the bus driver was 100% correct, with one minor exception, it wasn't Monday.  >You... on the other hand are as I said, just preaching the gospel of what you believe.  That is true, but I will give you an example of why I don't just accept everything without questioning it. Pam phones dispatch, Wiegert asks if the vehicle has any plates, or something like that. The argument was, how did he know the vehicle didn't have any plates! My argument was, that he may have simply been asking in an open ended way, rather than just assuming the vehicle had plates. So I'm happy to argue both ways when based on common sense.  >Big difference. But nice try anyways on trying to paint me as a guilter. Sorry, might work with a guilter to just say \"you already believe he's guilty\", but not with me.  It wasn't a try, it's just that everything you seem to think, happens to point to Avery's and Brendan's guilt. I'm sure if we did a quick Q&A, you would see what I mean.  >If you continue that line of debate, then our reasonable talk is not really possible anymore. We both know you have made your mind up.  I agree, I have made up my mind, but would also be happy if someone could point out where I am wrong!

Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel, and you keep going until it equalizes. This is the key, you can't do this forever, at some point, at some gravity level, i'm sure before 125% more gravity, at our current ability to generate thrust from fuel, we will be unable to make space.  That's not how rockets work. A rocket is a giant, hollow tube where over 90% of the mass is the fuel weight. The volume of fuel scales faster than the volume of the container necessary to hold the fuel, so where a rocket that is the size of your arm may only be 50% fuel, a rocket that is the size of the empire state building is going to be well over 90%, and so on.   As a result, you are postulating a gravitational world in which exploding fuel is not enough to propel its own mass upward - you are going to have to need much stronger gravity than 2.125X in order to achieve this.   Is there a limit to how strong gravity can be and there still be an achievable escape velocity? Yes, for once, it's called a black hole. That has an escape velocity well over the speed of light. Similarly, I'm sure there is an escape velocity that would be unachievable through normal chemical combustion, but its a hell of a lot more than 2.25x earth gravity.   Let's put it this way:  > You have to remember that to just get 1 more pound into space, you have to add more fuel.  Yes.  > Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel,  NO.  If fuel cannot propel itself off the ground, it is not fuel. You are talking about a universe in which there is no combustible substance that has more potential energy, releasable through a chemical process, than its own resting potential energy. To put it another way, you do not have to add fuel to a ship JUST to compensate for the weight of the existing fuel - it is a ratio of the output power of the fuel + the dead weight vs. the necessary escape velocity.  You are trying to talk about a planet where there is no chemical combustion known to man that is capable of propelling things up. I ask you to think about the outrageous force of substances like TNT, and then think about the sort of gravitational field where if you put one kilogram of tungsten on top of one kilogram of TNT and blew it up, it would just get super hot and melt into the ground, instead of propelling the tungsten upward. I assure you, it would be a world without trees, and likely without complex organic life as we know it. In fact, with gravity that high, the 'planet' would likely be a superhot mass of dense elements. Again, I do have a degree in physics.  I applaud you for sticking to all this, however.

What if I add fuel to the 3rd stage of rockets, because you know, rockets have stages (sorry just trying to be equally condescending back to you as you are to me) Then for the 1st stage to get to it's designated altitude, it will have to adjust for that extra pound of fuel. You have to add more fuel to the 1st stage in order to achieve the necessary velocity.

You do understand that one can disagree with another, even strongly, and not be outraged, right?  Since your entire point is predicated on reading a person's intent carefully, do you not think it makes your position a little less trustworthy to ascribe outrage to those with whom you disagree?  Anyhow...  When I made my post, Eulenspiegel74's comment   >\"Gatekeeping in its finest form\"   was still toward the top, and therefore the connection was more obvious. It's now low enough down and nested deeply enough that I had to actually go and unnest comments to find it. That's life on reddit, I guess. Unlike you, RadiumJuly did not fight that assertion. His response was   >\"I guess you could view it like that, you are welcome to it.\"  Gatekeeping, as I understand it, and as I use it here, is   >When someone takes it upon themselves to decide who does or does not have access or rights to a community or identity.  To me, it seemed as though RadiumJuly was implying that those who do not play in a way he likes\u2014with little regard for optimization\u2014are, by definition, not a seasoned or veteran or, to use the OP's language, experienced player.   I specifically contrasted my view with his, because my idea of an experienced\/seasoned\/veteran player does not need to play in a specific way or value a specific style, other than the enjoyment of those at the table. I put the bar at trying to make the game more fun\u2014inherently subjective, I admit\u2014for the people with whom you are playing. He places the bar with playing in a specific way, and does not mention anything about the subjective enjoyment of those you are with. He could very well have assumed the idea that one should also make the game \"better\" for those around you, but it wasn't anywhere in his list of requirements.   Now, you could argue that my definition is also a form of gatekeeping, and I suppose you'd be right. If a player actively tries to make the game less enjoyable for others, I would not let them past the gate of experienced\/seasoned\/veteran. But I draw a fairly firm line between the pursuit of the enjoyment for your group (no matter how they play) and a specific \"right\" way to play.  Finally, I concede that I may have read into RadiumJuly's comment more than he intended. If I did, mea culpa. I am clearly not the only one who misunderstood his intent if it was not as I interpreted it, but that is, again, one of the downsides to conversations on the internet.

You still have not demonstrated that there exists an agent that created us or the universe.

Nobody makes micro calculations at any given time because that's not how the mind works and just because it's a verifiable phenomenon doesn't mean you actually have to verify it to believe it.

Not on evidence. That is it's definition. It doesn't mean the belief is not warranted, simply that it's not based on reproducible evidence.  >No, I said that things weren't \"created\" by an agent.  To be honest, this is a misunderstanding that happened because I used a weird word for origin (creator) to make my point better. Now I hope it's clear how I use the word creator.  >How do you know this? \"Nothing\", as in philosophical \"nothing,\" doesn't exist, and we've never seen it.  Spare me the pseudo-intellectual bull.

The magic juice that runs all the secret military projects.  Not only that, but to be able to process hundred of thousands of humans DNA(Maybe millions!), compared with their lifetime achievements, singling out which achievements(Remember, every human have several achievements in their lifetime!) are gained by intelligence, calculating simple statistics over the literally, billions of billions of genes spread across the hundred of thousands humans. In order to find some correlating evidence that gene xyz might cause higher level of intelligence. That's all. I'm guessing, what, a beowulf cluster of 100 or so machines(Let's make 'em dual core for twice the juice!)? That should be enough right?   >This first pass analysis will identify genes for research ... gene groupings are identified that lead to higher intelligence, selective breeding programs ...  Yes.

Based on some simple and quite correct data about intelligence correlating genes. A simple first pass will allow us to figure out which genes might be magical.   >I don't think we'll have human-level AI until long after we've improved ourselves; you claimed we would. At any rate, once a human has designed an AI that is his equal, it is obvious that this AI can be cloned and then collaborate to improve on the design.  Throw more geniuses at the problem always seems to solve it. Like Fermat's last theorem. I heard Euler did a smashing job at it. Unfortunately that jerk Wiles had to ruin the party, some what, 500 years after it was first proposed?    You see, the problem with science is that it's always growing. It doesn't get easier to understand something when science grows. We'd like to think so. Ah, newton solved gravity! Haha! Another mystery shot down. Except... we don't know what causes gravity, do we? We can explain the effects of it under certain conditions. But we have no actual answer when someone asks, \"What is gravity?\".  When we finally create a machine with equal intelligence to that of a human, copying it won't make it easier to figure out how to improve it. The more we learn the more questions. In order to improve a highly effective machine, we need to get a better grasp of the technology and science involved. Sometimes we need to look at something completely different(To get the good 'ol Eurka moment). Doing so is a daunting task. Even for the smartest human. Creating a billion of super intelligent robots will only give you complex science with more questions that you can possibly imagine. It won't result in a super machine that understands everything. It won't create something that will improve it self in an ever exponentially growing speed.  [SEP] You clearly don't understand the significance of Moore's law. Yes, it may have become self-fulfilling prophecy due to the use of exponential projections in project planning and development, but the very fact that this is possible is of huge import. You claim it only applies to transistor number, and yet it has applied to a variety of technologies. Processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras all have increased at roughly exponential rates (thanks, Wikipedia). Add to that genomic sequencing and genomic synthesis - the exponential phenomenon is hitting biology in a big way. The biologists leading this revolution talk of leveraging the power of computation and digital technology to bring exponential growth in technology to biological problems.  By claiming that Moore's law, which is essentially the observation of exponential growth of technology, is meaningless, you only prove your ignorance. If it was only transistors that would be one thing, but there are too many examples of exponential growth in an array of digital technologies to say that there is no such phenomenon.  >Magical, fairy governmental data  Educational records, financial records, criminal records, medical records,... if you think there aren't already huge databases with all of this information on you, you are naive. Look at the Total Information Awareness project and tell me that modern governments don't have this data. Again, you only prove your ignorance.  If you think it is difficult to process this data, you would be correct - if you think it is impossible to process this data, you would be wrong.  Billions of genes? We have 25,000 genes; even with 100,000 alleles for every gene you only get to 2.5 billion genes, and this is still readily amenable to current processing technology. You can even try to think about including splicing, multiplying it up to trillions of genes, and we still have the computational ability to tackle the problem. A beowulf cluster of 100 machines, are you really that stupid? Try supercomputers with hundreds of thousands of cores, capable of petaflops. If these are already available at public universities, you really think that our military doesn't have a few? Your ignorance is astounding!  As for the correlation between various genetic profiles and its relationship to intelligence, once target genes have been identified this will require a few decades of cell and animal work before it becomes reasonable to design selective breeding programs. Still, the animal work has already begun - I recently read a paper in which a specific protein known to differentiate humans from all other primates that is implicated in speech development, and they've spliced it into mice. This work is crude at best, but it's already started. Amusingly, I was a subject of Duke TIP, a program that seeks to identify those with outstanding intelligence. A recent study collected our genetic information to correlate genes with intelligence... I sent off DNA samples a year ago after scoring in the top 1% of every standardized test I've ever taken.  As for whether people like it, sometimes people have no choice, as in China. Other governments might use IVF and surrogate mothers, technology already commercially available and that can be done completely via economic incentives. There would be some public pushback at the point this became public knowledge, but all our leaders would have to do is claim that the enemy of the day had a similar program and we must not allow ourselves to fall behind. People can be made to fall in line, just look at modern American politics.  Fermat's last theorem was a very difficult question and was solved through the collaborative efforts of hundreds if not thousands of intelligent individuals over hundreds of years, in some cases leveraging modern technology - this is a poster child for the sort of problem that would benefit from a billion geniuses cranking away at it. As for answering the question of gravity, this is a fundamentally hard question, similar to asking about consciousness or the origin of the universe. We might discover the hypothesized gravitons soon, but I don't think so.  >Creating a billion super intelligent robots will only give you complex science with more questions...  Our current society, with billions of regular Joes led by a relatively few intelligent folk, can already improve technology exponentially. Assuming each of these robots is the equivalent of a Newton or an Einstein and they are allowed to interface with each other to ask and answer questions and direct technological development, I can't begin to imagine what they might create. You are correct that making them clonal would be problematic in terms of their ability to think outside the box, as they would be thinking outside the box in the same manner, but there is no reason other than a lack of creativity to assume that a technology capable of creating human AI would be unable to create multiple diverse human AI.  You perhaps hate the current Singularity nuts who maintain we'll be downloading our consciousness to computers within our lifetime. I too think this is crap, and the technological progression I laid out occurs over the next century or two, not over the next few decades. I simply don't think that we're currently smart enough to generate human AI, which requires a very thorough and fundamental of human intelligence that we clearly lack. The beauty of statistics and correlation is that we can manipulate intelligence before we understand it to create outliers, hence why I believe we will create super-intelligent people before we create human-level AI.

I'll repeat myself: no matter how much you need to misread me, I don't endorse moral relativism.  >By asserting that \"we can make anything a right,\" you denied both the absolute existence of rights and the objective existence of rights.  No, for the same reason that married people and currency exist objectively. Unless you have a weird definition of what exists.  >Again, neither moral realism nor consequentialism would permit that \"we can make anything a right.\"  A consequentialist, say an utilitarian, could, to make it simple, just say that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility, while still holding that rights (like currency and marriages) are human institutions, albeit ones that tend to maximize utility in most (but not all) circumstances. That is a perfectly coherent stance.  >If moral facts exist, then it cannot possibly be true that \"we can make anything a right.\"   Give a non question-begging reason why.   Before you try, get this through your thick head: rights and moral facts are not mutually entailing concepts. If you think they are mutually entailing, that is a substantive thesis, not a conceptual one, thus you have to argue for it.  >The existence of moral facts is, however, the very basis of natural rights theory.  Sure, but natural rights theory is far from being entailed by moral realism, which I fucking endorse.  >You expressly claimed that \"we can make anything a right.\" This is the very essence of relativism.  You shoud produce an argument for this claim instead of merely repeating it.  >>No. That doesn't follow. All it would show is that natural selection has resulted in certain individuals expressing approval or disapproval of certain behavior. You can't jump from this to a metaphysical thesis.  >Not only does it follow--it's the same statement reiterated. A general biological predisposition to approve and disapprove of certain behavior is an innate moral impulse.  Nope, and I'm not surprised you don't see the distinction. Approval and disapproval are public, observable behavior. A moral impulse is an unobservable, para-mechanical explanation of that behavior. There is no reason to jump from one to the other, which is my point. Also, I didn't say individuals were pre-disposed, but that the behavior would be the result of natural selection. Different claims.  Anyway I reject the premise which states that approval and disapproval, which are learned social practices, are biologically determined.  >If you would really like to know, then I suggest you do some research on this topic. The relation between our chemical and biological matter and our moral impulses is a pretty \"hot\" issue at the moment, across several academic disciplines. However, it's usually the extent and nature of this relationship that I've seen debated, rather than the existence of the relationship, which is so self-evident that it seems presumed. By the way, philosophically, this fits under the banner of materialism. Maybe you skipped that wikipedia article?  Empty rhetoric. Stop bullshitting. Things that are so self-evident as to be presumed are called prejudice or dogma. But far from being self-evident, the idea that normativity reduces to biology is highly contested.

The scare quotes just show how weak even you believe it is. Is correlation causation now? What about immoral behavior of people with healthy brains? Couldn't this also be explained by the fact that we have a tendency to marginalize (i.e. express disapproval of) people with certain pathologies? And again, this is nothing to show the existence of moral facts, because that would require that expressions of approval or disapproval be correct or incorrect, have truth-value. This is something which no amount of biology could ever prove.  >But we do not need to locate a \"moral gene\" to determine that there is a genetic (i.e., bio-chemical and heritable) basis for morality.

Rights don't do that either. Suppose I grant that rights don't depend on institutions. Now imagine most social institutions have broken down and a powerful warlord wants to enslave you. The mere existence of the right to liberty will not prevent your enslavement. The right's efficiency clearly depends on its being agreed that it is a right, on institutional practices of recognizing and asserting rights. Without such practices the mere metaphysical existence of a right doesn't do shit.  Isn't it more parcimonious to say that rights are nothing but the institutional practices of declaring, granting, accepting, asserting, etc. rights? Just like currency is nothing but the practices of central banks to declare certain special pieces of paper to be so and banks, consumers, workers and businesses to accept that they are so? Without institutions, money would be worthless, and rights would have no force. Now a right with no force is as much of a contradiction as worthless money. [SEP] >You claim that it is faulty without anything to back it up. Rights are cultural institutions, like marriages and money.  The analogy is faulty because marriages and money are man-made institutions that can only exist due to one or more preexisting rights or related \"moral facts\". Your analogy conflates an institution's required antecedent with the institution itself. In other words, rights are not like currency or marriage, but are instead the necessary predecessors to currency and marriage.  >This question is nonsensical. Rights aren't theorems. They aren't proved.

Until then it's empty rhetoric to say that you could do it. I'll repeat myself: no matter how much you need to misread me, I don't endorse moral relativism.  In asserting that something is a right, we are making one or more moral propositions. Through the lens of moral realism, whether or not the asserted right actually exists will depend on whether or not its moral propositions are objectively true. For example, in asserting a human right to liberty, we make the moral proposition that slavery is immoral. If slavery is moral, it cannot be that there is a human right to liberty. You have argued that we can make anything a right. This means that the existence of a right cannot depend on the objective veracity of any underlying moral proposition. If we can make anything a right, no moral proposition is objectively true or false; instead, moral propositions are true if (as you argued) the operative inter-subjective agreement deems such propositions true. If no moral proposition is objectively true, than no right objectively exists. Thus, if we can make anything a right, nothing is objectively a right.  Now, you might sustain an argument that we can make anything a right and that rights are subjective. However, that obliterates the distinction between rights, on the one hand, and laws or rules, on the other and is, ultimately, nihilistic.  And, again, I'm not misreading you. You asserted that we can make anything a right. That statement is a statement of moral relativism. If you'd like to retract that statement, I invite you to do so. If you think that you can prove that moral realism or moral universalism permits your statement, I invite you to do so. Failing these actions, I must conclude that you are a moral relativist.  >No, for the same reason that married people and currency exist objectively.  Do you believe that moral propositions are objectively true or do you believe that moral propositions are true to the extent they reflect an operative inter-subjective agreement? The former is the view of moral realists. The latter is the view of moral relativists. The value of currency and the meaning of marriage can only be analogized to rights if you adopt the latter view of rights. In which case, you are declaring yourself a moral relativist (again).  >A consequentialist, say an utilitarian, could, to make it simple, just say that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility, while still holding that rights (like currency and marriages) are human institutions, albeit ones that tend to maximize utility in most (but not all) circumstances.  What do you think you demonstrated here? Answer this: if a utilitarian consequentialist said that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility could he also maintain that we can make anything a right? Could such a person, for example, accept that a right to inefficiency exists?  >Sure, but natural rights theory is far from being entailed by moral realism, which I fucking endorse.  Your rejection of natural rights theory was premised on your claim that \"we can make anything a right.\" This is inherently a rejection of natural rights theory and moral realism. If you'd like to reject natural rights theory on some other grounds, feel free to do so.  >Anyway I reject the premise which states that approval and disapproval, which are learned social practices, are biologically determined.  Do you therefore reject that there is a biological basis for any human attitude toward any behavior?  >But far from being self-evident, the idea that normativity reduces to biology is highly contested.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"reduces\" to biology. To the extent you're referring to a notion that culture has absolutely no influence on normativity, I never made such an assertion and would say that this claim is not only highly contested, but generally rejected. If, however, you're referring to the notion that biology has at least some influence on normativity, I would say that such a proposition is not highly contested, and is widely accepted. In any event, you had claimed (using more vulgar rhetoric) that I completely made up the notion that there was biological basis for moral judgments. Now, in stating that this concept is \"highly contested,\" you've conceded that I did not fabricate the argument.  >Cool. 'All cultures agree that X is wrong, therefore X is wrong as a matter of fact' is a non-sequitur. Ad populum.  I did not assert that the commonality of moral impulses across disparate cultures was evidence that such impulses were \"correct\". Rather, I asserted that the commonality of moral impulses across disparate cultures was evidence that such impulses had biological bases. Another straw man from the boy who cried straw man.  >Is correlation causation now? What about immoral behavior of people with healthy brains?  You're confusing necessary and sufficient conditions again. Clearly, brain pathology can cause immoral behavior and diminish a person's ability to perceive the immorality of his behavior. This indicates that our moral predispositions have a material basis--e.g., that our brain structures affect our moral impulses. Nothing about this relationship between certain brain pathologies and immoral behaviors excludes the possibility that people with structurally typical brains will act immorally. The argument is that brain pathology can be a sufficient condition for immoral behavior, not that brain pathology is a necessary condition for immoral behavior.  >Genetic doesn't mean 'bio-chemical and heritable', it means 'pertaining to genes'. Stop moving the goalposts to wiggle out of your bullshit claims.  What do you think genes are? Do you see your pattern here? Every time the conversation moves beyond your evident ability to grasp, you try to explain away your own ineptitude by reverting to the discourse of a more comfortable field (philosophy), in order to assert that some logical fallacy or impermissible mode of argument has occurred. Describing an attribute as \"bio-chemical and heritable\" is not \"moving the goalposts\" from describing such an attribute as genetic.  >Did you cum yet? Again: philosophy grad student, top of class, full scholarship. All I read here is empty rhetoric, pure bullshit and projection. I master the underlying issues and have to break them down for your dumb ass.  Your credentials are meaningless if the product of those credentials is deficient. At best you've exhibited some pedantic knowledge of certain \"terms of art,\" with limited mastery of the concepts those terms comprise and an extremely poor ability to understand, formulate or present logical arguments. Moreover, nothing about your writing, especially your propensity to devolve into vulgarity and churlishness when challenged, suggests any rigorous academic training or confidence with the subject matter. And I've not forgotten that this conversation began with you misstating the century in which the bulk of natural rights theory was developed (ironically in the context of a condescending comment attempting to mock me for presenting a natural rights thesis).  Further, your description of your credentials makes them suspect. Are you in a grad program that ranks its students? One that is graded on a curve? What does \"top of class\" mean in this context? Grade inflation in graduate programs, especially in the humanities, is rampant. My undergrad had one of the best Phil grad programs in the world. It was my understanding that anything below an A in that program was tantamount to failing and that this was the norm across comparable schools and disciplines. That's assuming you're even in a PhD program, which is questionable given your \"full scholarship\", as PhD programs waive students' tuition in exchange for undergraduate teaching\/TA work. And, even if your credentials are accurate, I have no way of verifying whether you're in top-ranked graduate program, or if you're attending some lesser-tier institution. From your \"work product\" in our conversations, however, I'd bet the latter.  Also, if we're listing credentials, I'm an attorney. I went to one of the best law schools in the country, on a full a scholarship. I studied for several months under John Mikhail, who has written extensively on the topics we've discussed and whose work Noam Chomsky has advised. I also studied constitutional law, including the philosophical bases for modern notions of fundamental rights, under several of the leading jurists in the country. And I've discussed the moral and philosophical underpinnings for the Prop-8 litigation with Ted Olson and his legal team, so I have seen first hand how these arguments are grounded and litigated at the highest levels in this country. Thus, while I wouldn't claim mastery of philosophy at an academic level, I certain know enough to recognize someone with real ability and knowledge in the field--I think you can guess my estimation of you in this regard.","target":"condescension"},{"text":"I think \"intimidated\" happens a lot less often than women like to believe.

That is where I very strongly disagree with you. While there are thousands of people with PhDs who make judgements on this text, there are over a Billion and a half Muslims without PhDs who do make judgements on these texts, and the judgements they make influence the way they live their lives, and the way they live their lives influences global politics. Most Muslims in the world want peace and prosperity for their family and to just get along, like most people in the world. But some (talking about ISIS, Boko Haram, etc. here) want very different things, or have very different definitions for those things. Obviously, Western imperialism is a massive superstructure of a reason for the conflicts we experience now. But why does the resultant unrest take the form it does, and why is it so successful at creating individual cells through social media and persuasion? Those Islamist terrorists live their lives they way they do partly due to their interpretations of their holy texts (and indeed, most of those groups espouse a caliphate\/lifestyle emulating as closely as possible the one created and ruled by Muhammad, and all their evidence comes from these holy texts), and most of them do not have PhDs, and yet they make judgements on those texts that influence the way they live their lives, and the way they live their lives influences global politics.

I'm Muslim (Sunni) myself and a communist (though that knowledgeable in both yet).    Islam can be compatible with Communism. Islam and Communism agree on peace among people, equality and justice.    As for matters such as women praying behind men, I guess that is to protect the dignity of women and keep the men focused on praying, if you know what I mean.   ~~Don't quote me on this, but I think when Quran talks to the masculine pronoun (he), it often means both males and females because they are basically the same (Eve was made out of one rib of Adam).~~ Most of the verses in which there are orders, God refers to Muslims in a plural noun. For example: \"Don't pray while you are drunk\". You in this case means a group a people, so it is both male and female.   I have never heard of the necessity of a man having to accompany a woman in the street (in Hajj, yeah, but not in everyday life). Women here in Egypt walk without a brother or a husband to accompany them. I can say that it isn't bad for a woman in case of Hajj, we all know women aren't as strong as men, maybe she gets tired and wants to rest or something, she needs a man to rely on.    Finally, I don't support the FSA, neither Erdogan and any sane human being can agree with me, but sadly, there is a lack of common sense in the middle East region lately (Saudi Arabia and Israel congratulate Trump on attacking Syria, is a good example). People focus too much on religious domination and less on developing the countries and fight corruption. Don't let those people alter your image on Islam, it's their fault, not the the religion.

It doesn't matter why it is done, the fact that it furthers a gendered society and de facto female inferiority. Gender segregation, even if it's for a \"good\" reason, is extremely condescending when put into practice. I do not want to see my female comrades regulated to the back of the room either today or in a future society.  Also, there are plenty of religious institutions where men and women are integrated which do not have an issue of \"less focus\". That entire premise (that women are inherently \"distracting\" and must be controlled) hurts progress towards female emancipation.  >we all know women aren't as strong as men, maybe she gets tired and wants to rest or something, she needs a man to rely on.  I find statements like this to also be problematic. Our goals as communists isn't to reinforce the mythologies of the past, but to work towards breaking them.

She is pretty inconsistent and seems more like a plot device rather than a well-rounded character. (I feel that way about Hamlin too.) You can't exactly say who she is and what her motivations are, especially when it comes to her relationship with Jimmy.  When I first watched the show - I binge watched all the 3 seasons - the show putting Jimmy in a relationship with Kim came as a surprise to me and didn't make much sense for me. Considering Jimmy's character evolution, what they were going for in season one seemed like the right way: he was a struggling lawyer in financial troubles, everybody told him he was like a shady person\/lawyer, his brother and personal idol turned out to be among that crowd too, his best friend passed away, and the girl he liked rejected his offer for a partnership. Jimmy's character was at a perfect point to enter the next phase of his evolution. But in season 2 they suddenly backpedaled.  Now, I have a theory of my own! Watching the show and reading some interviews by Gilligan (and Gould) gave me the feeling and the idea that the show creators, Vince Gilligan especially, became so fascinated by and interested in Michael McKean's performance as Chuck that they wanted to give him more storylines and to keep him around longer to act as the mentally ill and vindictive older brother. (because if you come to think of it, as a supporting character, Chuck had kind of served his purpose by the end of season one. He had dissed and rejected Jimmy and that was one of the main things that put Jimmy\u2019s journey to the dark side in motion.)   Gilligan himself said in an interview that initially Chuck was never intended to be the villain of the piece the way he turned out to be, he was supposed to be a normal, albeit ill, brother to Jimmy, but watching McKean act out Chuck with a hint of arrogance in his first scenes with Odenkirk gave them the idea to write Chuck the way they did. Now, in order to have more of McKean as the arrogant and mentally ill brother, they had to postpone Jimmy's character development and to give him something to do, hence the Davis and Main storyline and his relationship with Kim as well as Kim getting more screen-time and storylines herself. And as you said, by the time they got to season 3, the Kim character and the Kim-Jimmy relationship had become too popular to let go.  [SEP] >Gilligan himself said in an interview that initially Chuck was never intended to be the villain of the piece the way he turned out to be, he was supposed to be a supporting and normal, albeit ill, brother to Jimmy, but watching McKean act out Chuck with a hint of arrogance in his first scenes with Odenkirk gave them the idea to write Chuck the way they did  I gotta call B.S. on this. It's evident in the writing that Chuck was going to betray Jimmy. From the very first scene, when he coos over his Financial Times, basically ignores Jimmy, and Jimmy has to almost beg Chuck to give him a minute of his time to talk. Chuck was written as brilliant and totally condescending.   This is something that Gilligan frequently does that irritates me. He spoke more than once about being 'surprised' at that Walt was able to 'redeem' himself at the end of BrBa. Bullhockey. They knew right from the start that the show would end with Walt's victory and happy death. Now, the details of how that happened had to be worked out, but they knew all along.   As for making Jimmy and Kim a couple, I dunno what they were thinking there. Kim knew he was sketchy, with a troubled past, and she kept him strictly in the friend zone, with a little playful flirting now and then. Then she participates in a third-rate low-level con with him, and practically throws herself at him? And why is this couple so popular anyway? I guess because they never show them in any serious disagreement, and they do a nice job of observing the small behavioral details that couples engage in, i.e. they are a nice, normal couple. But this leads right back to your earlier point about making Saul a nice, normal guy with the usual hang-ups and not the uniquely interesting, somewhat troubled person of Breaking Bad.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"You get violent to prevent perceived, possible violence in the future...

You're admitting that state socialism, as you call it, is a necessary precondition to what you're calling communism, but you're failing to articulate any method that could actually manage to transition from the former to the latter without the whole framework collapsing on itself.

How can voluntary business arrangements be \"illegal\" in a system that doesn't have a state to enforce positive law.

But the original status quo that the initial \"socialist\" program seeks to overturn *is* what was manifested by society itself without anyone attempting to impose a single, top-down plan on the whole of it.  Socialism *is* that top down plan, so again, why would things not revert back to their prior state rather than move into the next phase of that artificial plan once the artificial force is removed?  > As for creating a post scarcity society, we're already getting there.  As a result of technological improvements that are facilitated by open markets, and certainly not as a result of communist subversion of extant economic institutions.  The reductions in economic scarcity we see on the horizon are the result of the \"means of production\" being *more easily* developed and controlled by private parties, enabling people to own more private property to provide for their own needs.  This is the exact opposite of communism's goal of suppressing private property and subjecting all \"means of production\" to some vaguely-defined control by the \"community\" (which, by the way, I can't distinguish in operational terms from state control).  > Having corruption for a short while and achieving a incorruptible system  There is no such thing as an \"incorruptible system\" -- the idea that progressing through the (by your own admission) thoroughly corruptible system of state socialism can somehow alter the fundamental antecedents of human behavior such that the end result after removing that corrupt system will somehow be \"incorruptible\" is an irresolvable paradox.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"I really do not want to come across the wrong way here but this is genuine curiosity born out of other similar incidents that I have had a very close exposure to.

(Disclaimer: I'm a government worker, but not for DoD.)  Set anti-government prejudice aside for a second and think about it. The government (especially the United States gov.) is held to much higher standards than any individual private company. Private CEO holds emails in his private account? No one cares. Someone dies on a private job? Send in OSHA, but it won't warrant news coverage. Several people get injured or killed at work? Maybe a page A-8 news article. Maybe.   Curious about particular events at any private workplace, and put in a request for documents? \"Lol, fuck off or get a subpoena.\" Curious about government operations? Submit a FOIA. You don't even need a reason, you can just request \"All documents related to V at site W facility X from Dates Y to Z.\" They take forever, may be denied or redacted...but you'll get a response eventually. And then can ask again. And again.  My point is, the government knows that any single thing it does can be inspected by the general public at some point, with or without context. And as such...it's very careful about the things it does.   Could you imagine if the gov. told an employee who had concerns about safety, \"Do this job, or I'll fire you and find someone who will.\" ? Because I promise you that that absolutely doesn't happen. If anyone has a concern for any reason even just an observer who has no contextual information about the situation can stop work, and cause a lengthy stop, reevaluate, and start up process.   And in the event of a FOIA request - all of that will be available. The meeting minutes and planning emails from months or years before the project started. The engineering evaluations on the plans and subsequent modifications. The QA inspections on those grade 8 bolts you ordered from a specific manufacturer because they're able to provide pedigree on the metal and manufacturing of those bolts, unlike some of their competitors who try to slip in the occasional Chinese counterfeit. The science studies they commission on a particular lot of those bolts to provide a secondary check on the manufacturers work, to ensure that the bolts provided are in fact, grade 8 bolts.   And god forbid any mistakes happen during any of those processes, or there are inconsistencies in the paperwork, or some of the paperwork is missing - the conspiracy theorists go nuts. Here's a good example minus details.   Someone maintained on on-site office. But absolutely never spent any time there. Always traveling around the states on business, he spent maybe 2 weeks in that office quarterly. But that wasn't always the case, at one point he was doing research into the history of a process, and requested some of the record paperwork from the period - basically an internal FOIA request. The vast majority of it was irrelevant and ended up returned, but he was interested in a portion that he held onto to work with at the time. Ended up traveling, doing other work. Forgets about the logs on his bookshelf. Years later, is finally told to clean out the office he never uses the next time he's back, and he does. Most of the stuff on the shelves is just personally made references, procedures in binders. Printed, self organized stuff. He's busy, so he just ends up tossing it all in recycling.   Fast forward a year and a half. Someone has submitted a FOIA request for the \"lot\" (literally, lot, as in there are so many records that they come together in \"lots\") that the subset of records he had kept, were a part of. And in verifying those records before giving a copy to the requester, realized that a small subset of sections were missing. So they came to the original requester - who was no longer there - and did interviews of everyone around to see what they remembered. The company he worked for still worked for the government, and he still worked for that company, just not at the same site. The finding was made, that he had tossed those records out when he cleaned out his office. (Why the hell the records division had turned over \"originals\" to someone instead of making copies and turning those over caused a QA person to practically have an aneurysm.) Six months later his company fired him for the mistake, despite the fact that it had happened years ago, and was entirely an innocent mistake.

I don't think Deroir was rude, or mean, or nasty; he was very polite but that's sort of irrelevant (microaggressions are usually \"polite\"). I also don't think he intended to be hurtful or sexist. That said he did unconsciously fall into a pattern of behavior that is hurtful and sexist. This is what I've been trying to say from the beginning. His comment is textbook mansplaining, and that's a sexist behavior, even if you don't stand up and shout the C-word and tell a woman she should go back to the kitchen. You can be sexist without it being overt sexism, and that sucks. It's happened to me before  But to argue that he \"did nothing wrong\" because he was polite and because his intentions were good is counterproductive to efforts to actually fight subtle\/covert sexism. It's important to recognize, even if you think her response was out of line, that his comment fits an ongoing pattern of sexist behavior in our society, and even more egregiously in this community in particular. And hopefully we can agree that that means that, intentional or not, polite or not, he actually did something wrong.

I once got lucky where a private equity firm bought a client and mandated they all take part and cooperate, but those were exceptional circumstances.  > How are you doing with prospecting?

[SEP] > Yeah, if I qualified prospects by the criteria of all having stakeholders present and on board, then I'd be lucky to have one client per country  You misunderstand me, you don't wait to have everyone in the room to consider them qualified, like you say, that would mean you make no progress. But you need to consider who are all the folks involved in making a purchase decision, talk to them and gather information from them, the procurement officer will have different motivations to an Op's guy, this will help you discern their internal priorities and help you avoid objections like \"we have no budget\".  Once an account is qualified you then move to the next phase of your sales cycle, such as pitching, value building, quoting etc and this is when it's helpful to have more people involved from their side. If you identified they don't make a purchase decision without the COOs involvement, but they want a demo, then you make sure you're not just demoing to a sysadmin for example, you should endeavour to get someone from the COO's office involved also to help you maintain momentum and get your account to move towards consensus.

I've been making films in Columbia, MO for the past few years. It's a college town, so it isn't super tiny, but it's not a metropolis. In my time here we've shot in diners, concert venues, screenprinting shops, movie theaters, school campuses, and (tonight, if all goes well) grocery stores. Here's the biggest thing I've learned, not just in regards to locations, but indie filmmaking in general:  Ask without expectation, and allow yourself to be surprised by the generosity of others.  Politeness is the name of the game. It seems obvious, but be as upfront as you can. You want them to say yes, but you also don't want to burn any bridges for people who may ask later. You have to be a positive force for your local film community, and if local businesses have a bad experience, it may shut them off for future filmmakers.  First of all, you should put together an information sheet in indesign or something similar. Provide a brief synopsis of your film, a description of your situation, a brief list of what you need, and the contact information for your producer, assistant director, and possibly yourself. At the bottom, have a few lines where they can fill out information that you can tear off and take with you. That way you can have paperwork to show them that you're actually making a film and not just trying to get free food or something. (Trust me, this goes a LONG way in making you look legit.)  Here's an example  When you go in to talk to a manager\/owner, be polite. Did I mention that already? Oh, well here it is again: BE POLITE. Nobody likes an auteur complex, and acting like a big shot will only turn them off. Tell them your name, shake their hand and introduce yourself as a local filmmaker. Explain that you're shooting a film, and you have a scene set in [wherever], and you were hoping you could use their store. Speak with confidence.  Explain what you'll be using it for, what you'll be doing, and how long you will need. (Have you worked on many productions before? Because if you're new to filmmaking, understand that even simple setups take a LONG time. We requested 4 hours in a grocery store to get one shot, so give yourselves enough time without over-asking.)  In most of these locations, you will want to shoot overnight while they're closed, so you can better control your environment without interfering with business. This sounds like a lot to ask, but businesses are usually very responsive to this, IF you offer to pay the hourly wage of an employee to come in and oversee the production. Even if you're shooting a no-budget short, it's more than worth it to pay someone $12 an hour for 8 hours to come in, because not only could it make the difference between getting the location and not, but they'll also be able to shut off refrigerator compressors, turn off air conditioners, (really turn off anything that will ruin your audio) and tell you which outlets are on what breakers. They're great to have, and it will only cost you upwards of $150 for an entire night.   Once you're done stating your case, leave them the information sheet with your contact information. And whether or not they say yes, be understanding, and thank them for their time. Remember: You went in without expectations, so you don't have anything to be disappointed about. But if they say yes, you've just made a valuable new partner. And assuming you get the location, treat it with the utmost respect. Be careful with equipment, and leave it exactly how you left it. Don't take advantage of their generosity.  On my last short, we were shooting a scene in a police station\/police chief's office, and all of the local police departments (understandably) said no. In a last-ditch attempt, I started walking door-to-door asking businesses if they had an office we could use. Most didn't, but EVERY ONE was receptive, and tried to help me however they could. Finally I wandered into a screenprinting shop, and the owner was one of the most enthusiastic people I've worked with. We came in on a weekend when they were closed and shot for 12 hours over 2 days. He let us re-arrange anything and everything, all while he sat at work on a Saturday. When we left, we cleaned up everything, put things back and took out the trash. We left the location better than when we found it. A few months later I was shooting a short comedy sketch, and we needed an office. An hour before our shoot, our location fell through, so I called the owner of the screenprinting shop. Because of how we treated the location the last time, we got to come in again with an hour notice to shoot the sketch.  As independent filmmakers it's easy to paint business owners as nasty crumudgeons who don't want people invading their stores. But you need to remember that in a sense, you're a small business owner as well. Treat them with respect, but treat them like a peer. Kindness and respect will get you very far. [SEP] hi. Your post about the supermarket was actually what prompted me to write this!  >Ask without expectation, and allow yourself to be surprised by the generosity of others.  Golden rule right there.  >You have to be a positive force for your local film community, and if local businesses have a bad experience, it may shut them off for future filmmakers.  I went to film school so there were a lot of businesses in the area that had worked with other students before. You could always tell who had a good experience and who had a bad one.  I've done plenty of productions. Not as many as most people here probably, but enough to know things can move slow and those 12 hour days really are necessary.  Great idea about paying an employee to come overnight!  Also: >for your producer, assistant director, and possibly yourself.   Hahaha!

Also, you are taking both of them out of their historical contexts and placing them into the world of today where antisemitism is generally perceived as being an evil. Similarly, just because you have negative feelings towards the Catholic church does not mean that the institution is a criminal organization. A lot of evil has been done in its name, but since its beginning it has also been doing good. Just as the United States is responsible for both good and evil, writing it off as a criminal organization would disregard the good that it has done throughout history.  You ask how can I presume that I am right about my current thought, in the same manner, how do we know that psychologists, physicists, literary analysts, etc., are right about there thought today? Theology is just as valid of a institutional field of study as any of those, and through this scholarship, a more accurate interpretation and understanding of its content is achieved. Now are my views the final say on the Christian tradition? No, just as scientific thought today will eventually be seen as being antiquated, so will current Theological thought. However, as Theology progresses, it will definitely build upon the ideas in use today.  In regard to your point concerning slavery and violence, when looking at its historical context, the Hebrew culture promoting slavery and violence was hundreds of years ahead of its time in terms of human rights. If you do a study on slavery within the Hebrew nation versus the study of other nations in the Ancient Near East, you will quickly see that the Hebrews were downright humanitarian. Also, the condoning of slavery was not the final word of the Hebrew scripture, rather as the society progressed, slavery eventually became condemned. In order to see and understand this, a person must be very familiar with the meta-narrative of the Old Testament and the history of its development.  Finally, by saying that you would not act in a certain way if you were God, is providing an anthropomorphic version of God. God is not human any more than you are God, and attributing human motives to God is mistaking the fundamental nature of God as being finite.   Once again, I hope that this clears up some points for you. Also, I would highly recommend taking some type of Biblical scholarship class at a university so you can get a more comprehensive understanding of the development of religion.   [SEP] >I hope that this clears up some points for you  I will give you a single point for being hilariously condescending, but that does nothing for your deluded position.  You have attempted to excuse centuries of institutionalized subjugation and genocide committed against a particular race\/sect of people. This is unacceptable. Men, women, children, the elderly, infants; none were spared by the servants of Christ when they thirsted for blood, which was quite often. The Holocaust was simply the cherry on the cake of the centuries of unmitigated hatred and slaughter.  To attempt to sweep this under the rug is absolutely unforgivable behavior and proves that you are not right in the head.  You have tried to discount the never ending string of crimes, the unbroken chain of evil, committed by the Catholic church as me having \"bad feelings\". You are either an apologist or you haven't the slightest idea of the heinous history of the church. I challenge you to name an atrocity that can be committed by one human against another that has not been performed by the church in an official capacity. Genocide, unbridled and shameless greed, slavery, subjugation of indigenous peoples around the globe, institutionalized child rape, you name it.  >Theology is just as valid of a institutional field of study as any of those  I'm going to break character here - that of the man who clearly has the higher ground in both education and a grip on reality - and mention to you that your statement quoted above is the most retarded thing I have read in a very long time that wasn't in crayon.

I think that diving into these methods is worth the time at some point. I've done some swimming in this water previously, and will again at a reasonable time for me. My take is that the best alternative voting system is the one we can get, and that holding out for one at the cost of the other is wrongheaded. But that having that discussion at this stage is critical.  I believe it's inherently evident that RV holds the potential to capture more of the voters intent, because instead of capturing a simple order, you are quantifying how potent that order is. 9, 7, 0, holds more info than 1, 2, 3. It includes a magnitude of the ranking. Then the devil is in the details of the 'recount'. This means that it will certainly be possible to find the situation where perfection has not be obtained via IRV\/IR. How much concern to give such a scenario is still debatable for me, balanced against other factors.  For instance, I also think that that added info then adds complexity to the education and debate, especially where it comes to the voters own actions. EVERYone needs to be able to understand what's being asked of them.  However, (and I don't mean to be a dick here, rather to be respectfully honest in my feedback) this presentation was literally a negative in terms of educating me_.

I also would not have swapped the use of candidate last-name first-letters in the study, to political affiliation in your notations. For one thing, there also seemed to have been some combining of candidates that I can't figure out, not sure. That added a level of processing that really ended my willingness to do the math with you.  I had to simply start reading through the data to try to figure out the situation for myself (not a bad result of course but not what most people will do with that).

I'm far from married to any method because frankly I want the best voting method system too.  Personally I LIKE the RV method. I'd be happy using it BTW. My feeling is that more info is better, but that depends greatly on the specific steps used to effect the 'runoffs'.  I remain of the opinion that any alternative method is such an improvement as to make them worthwhile, that using one can be a stepping stone to other methods, and if we hold out for some folks perception of the perfect, we're stuck. But now is the time to hash that all out! [SEP] > 9, 7, 0, holds more info than 1, 2, 3  Not only does it contain more information, more of that information is used.  Under IRV, the only thing that the method cares about is who is your favorite of the candidates that are still in the running. If literally everybody votes for a centrist as their #2 candidate, IRV completely ignores that fact; because they aren't the favorite of anyone, they would then be eliminated before any votes could be transferred to them (similar to what happened in Burlington)  > How much concern to give such a scenario is still debatable for me, balanced against other factors.  That is a legitimate question, and why I specifically pointed out Burlington; it was only their 2nd or 3rd election running with IRV, so it went sideways pretty quickly.   > Both the write-up and the study are convoluted, dense, mathematically complex, full of jargon and unexplained special notation.

Best bet is the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 44 years. That's not \"all-time.\" Citation:  http   - employment doesn't mean a single goddamn thing if the job sucks. And all the jobs suck. The clearest gauge of this is real wages - the purchasing power of the dollars you're getting for the work - and that basically flat. As the economy grows the dollars don't reach real people. Citation:  http   - while companies have never been richer, the poverty rate isn't changing. It's higher now than ~45 years ago. That's absurd. Citation:  http #\/faq\/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states  - you talk about \"entitlement,\" but let's look at the millennial generation. Americans aged 25-35, people who should have growing families and starter homes and solid careers, are averaging a salary of $35k a year. That's $20k less annually than their parents! Their average net worth is less than $11,000! Citation:  http   - people take \"gig economy\" jobs out of desperation, forsaking real salary and benefits for the prospect of some money right now. But even the average gig economy pay dropped 50% from 2013-2017. People are screwed. Citation:  http   - meanwhile corporations have never had more cash or lower taxes. And what do they do with that money? Make their own lives easier. None found its way to employees - as we showed earlier.

I'm talking about crap like this:  http  [SEP] > Best bet is the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 44 years.  I.e. it's a generational high. It's true that when you factor in people who have left the labor market it might be higher, but you'd expect the availability of jobs to be pulling those people back in. I read a few days back that on some metrics we're hitting all-time highs. Whatever, better-than-any-time-in-my-lifetime makes the point well enough.  > while companies have never been richer, the poverty rate isn't changing.  Companies getting richer is a problem. The problem is that competition has become increasingly difficult. Far fewer businesses are started today. Here's a citation for you. When you have less competition, profits go up.  I'm not sure why you'd expect to see a drop in US poverty. It's losing jobs to places that have true poverty, so it's hard for Americans to compete on wages--and they can't compete on much else. You'd need effective social programs to help, and you don't have that.  In any case, though, full employment means wages start to go up. And sure enough, they are; the trend in the last couple years is towards real, actual wage growth.  > [Millennial are doing poorly]  When you come right down to it, for them to do better the economy would have to change. Or, I guess, we'd have to dramatically raise taxes and dramatically redistribute wealth.  The Left wants to hamstring the economy and redistribute wealth, turning the country into an unsustainable charity system. Higher corporate taxes hamper the competitiveness of American companies abroad. More regulation means that starting up new businesses is harder, which means less competition, which means higher corporate profits and lower wages (because there's no competition for employees).  At the same time, the Right has lost it's fucking mind.  > meanwhile corporations have never had more cash or lower taxes. And what do they do with that money? Make their own lives easier. None found its way to employees - as we showed earlier.  See, if you knew anything about economics you'd know that lower corporate taxes are fine. You immediately seem to confuse what they are when you say they \"make their own lives easier\". What lives? Are you talking about corporations making their metaphorical 'corporate' lives easy? Or are you talking about the execs and shareholders?  If you want to tax the execs and shareholders...how about you do that instead? Tax high earners. US companies have a hard enough time competing abroad; why kneecap them with very high corporate taxes?  You know that all those leftie Scandinavian social democracies have low-to-0% corporate taxes?  > So you might think someone is \"entitled\" because they want a living wage for a full-time job.  ...Handed to them by default. Where \"living wage\" means affording a house and car and supporting a family in modern-day America. Yep, I do think that's entitled. That's an expectation that a very small percentage of the people in the world today can have--even in developed countries. Forget about the past as recently as a generation ago, where more than half of tho population of the world was at immediate risk of starvation. The only group in history that could expect that was Americans from the 1950's to the ~1980's, for complex historical reasons, and even then we're looking back with rose-colored glasses: things were not as easy as millennials make out, and expectations have risen.   > Go travel to a country that doesn't allow half the shit the US does and guess what, this crap doesn't happen.

You should stop talking.\"  That post is Economics 101, man. You may be under the impression that wage rates come down from On High, but they're determined by supply and demand, full stop.

Quite a lot. This is why I think it's useful because readers of buzzfeed can start to have a little more feminism brought up to them on the regular. Some will choose to look deeper into feminism which only helps. Some will continue to hold the same beliefs they had before reading an article, no harm no foul. Some may twist around something that they read and make incorrect assumptions but as I've stated multiple times there isn't enough factual information in these articles to actually be mislead about anything concrete. But if someone is mislead it's easy enough to correct because buzzfeed is very general by nature.  >Wouldn't the Occupy Movement been a lot more credible and thus more effective if they actually had their facts straight? You could argue that the Occupy Movement didn't actually achieve much of anything, so why would the Buzzfeed articles about feminism achieve anything either?  The OWS movement spawned greater consciousness amongst the entire country of the vast wage gap between the \"1%\" and the \"99%\" and the unfair ways financial institutions are able to hold on to that money, forcing it out of circulation. The results from this \"awakening\" aren't easy to quantify but certainly can't be called negative. Keeping people passionate about the state of inequality isn't bad either. It still does more good than harm.  >In my counrty the actual wage gap statistic is roughtly 3% when you look at women and men who work in the same sector with the same job description. That gap is explained by the fact that men tend to take a lot more overtime work than women, and generally just work more hours. The real issue is the costs involved with pregnancy and the understandable reluctancy from employers to hire women who might receive paid maternity leave in the near future. But hardly anyone knows about this real issue because we're overwhelmed by the irrelevant memes from Buzzfeed and tumblr. Besides that, most (if not all) of the things Buzzfeed is fighting aganst are completely trivial compared to the hardship women face in non-western countries.  You're really blaming buzzfeed and feminist memes for the reason behind people not being aware of the reason behind the wage gap? That's a pretty big leap. Nobody looks at a gif of a cat and immediately thinks \"well this is all I'll ever need to know about feminism.\" And if they do then that person is a danger to many parts of society and the fault is on them or their upbringing, not buzzfeed. Morons who actively seek to populate their mind with only the baseline information on a subject and then aggressively use only that to form an opinion on the entirety of an extremely complex issue aren't the people we should cater our media production to. Nor are they the people that we should predicate judgment of buzzfeed or anyone else based on.  I'm merely saying buzzfeed is a good source for being exposed to a popular side of feminism through harmless gifs and entertainment. It's not the most educational, but it does have the power to influence people to further educate themselves, or a place for people who are in the struggle to feel validated and a sense of camaraderie with other women who are experiencing similar treatment and emotions.

Again, this sub isn't for ideological debates, so I'm not going to get too far into this. When anarchists, communists, and all other kinds of socialists talk about means of production, they're referring to property that is used to produce goods. A factory and the machines and equipment inside it would be an example of means of production. In a socialist economy, that would be owned collectively, and the workers would decide how the factory was run democratically.   > What happens when some workers have a disagreement with other workers about what should be done?

The thing is, the church's money came from me. It came from my parents, who faithfully paid tithing and extra fast offering even when we didn't have enough money for groceries. We all gave money to the church because we believed they would use it for charitable purposes, not a for-profit venture.

They couldn't even take down a 3rd rate military power like Libya on their own without the US's help in neutralizing air defenses, providing logistical support and even supplying munitions when their own stocks were depleted after just a few weeks of war.

Our share in military expenditure is, taken together, not as big as the US (of course), but more than enough to defend the EU if we had a unified military. The latter part is the real problem.  You are right that we cannot act. I just doubt you have the right reasons in mind. The response I gave above points out what I think the underlying problem is here: we have no political will or sufficient external threat in order to force each member state to essentially give up their autonomous military service. On the other hand, no single member state is strong enough to project power in all of Europe.  This creates a horrible dilemma, especially since the existence of the US and US intervention makes any solution redundant. But I believe this isn't about money, rather about how we use it. Right now, each member state spends it on its own military, hence you get 28 different militaries that cannot act in unison, each strong enough to protect its own nation but nothing much else.  The same money would buy you a force that would be the 2nd strongest on this planet. For reasons mentioned above, this isn't happening.

So you have to excuse a few of us to make the mistake of projecting this to areas of the world that aren't as lucky as we are.

Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape  A suspect who has physically overpowered a police officer and disarmed him of a TASER has demonstrated that he poses a threat of serious harm, as does a suspect who has indicated a willingness to drag and\/or run over a police officer attempting to permit his escape in that vehicle.  In Graham v. Conner the court held that: >As in other Fourth Amendment contexts, however, the \"reasonableness\" inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officers' actions are \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation. See Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 137 -139 (1978); see also Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 21 (in analyzing the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure, \"it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard\"). An officer's evil intentions will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable use of force; nor will an officer's good intentions make an objectively unreasonable use of force constitutional.

Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973). - See more at: http:\/\/caselaw.findlaw.com\/us-supreme-court\/490\/386.html#sthash.5BNFOFTQ.dpuf  In contrast you have attempted to judge uses of force based on what you believe to be the personality of the police officer involved (whether you have any evidence to support a personality judgement or not) regardless of the objective facts.  >Did you even read the article I linked to?

Feminism says that we must dismantle the patriarchy, which is an organization of men that focuses on advantaging men over women. Manspreading, mansplaining, and manterrupting are words invented to describe and criticize men. The wage gap is about a supposed systematic advantage of men over women. Feminist complaints about representation are complaints that men are overrepresented compared to women. Feminist complaints about STEM fields are complaints that there are too many men and not enough women. What is the feminist slogan about rape? \"Teach men not to rape\". Why do they want people to say \"chair\" instead of \"chairman\"? Because they don't like the man in charman. What other words don't they like? Postman, mailman, policeman.   Man, that's a lot.

What neocolonialism has done is distort their development so that it fits in with global value chains. This requires a degree of keeping capitalism underdeveloped, retaining pre-capitalist social formations like feudalism in the countryside. While the cities may become incredibly industrialized, agriculture is held back, and the state becomes a tool not just of the capitalist class, but of the comprador capitalists who act in service of global imperialism.  This is a huge oversimplification and very much feels like an attempt to fit contemporary developments into old theoretical frameworks that don't suit them (feudalism in agricultural relations, really?). But it at least demonstrates an awareness that globalisation is happening which your previous post didn't. Really, saying contemporary imperialism blocks \"developments towards industrialisation\" just suggests to me that you haven't actually read much literature on modern geopolitics and are still trying to understand them from the perspective of Lenin's work on imperialism, which, aside from anything else, was written to describe a very different global socio-economic situation than the one we face now.

Socialist states don't have to completely cut off from trade, but when that trade benefits imperialism, its a necessity that they do.   Sorry, you can't have capitalist exchange without capital. And you especially now can't have global capitalist exchange without global capital, not in a world where global multi-nationals are bigger than the states in question.  >Where did I ever give off the idea I'm advocating reform lol  Oh, I didn't mean to imply that you were.

The text is also very contextual to the time it was written and isn't exactly universal in all aspects.  Right then. So what did he mean by this?  >We have said that there could not have been Social-Democratic consciousness among the workers. It would have to be brought to them from without. The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labour legislation, etc. The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical, and economic theories elaborated by educated representatives of the propertied classes, by intellectuals. By their social status the founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia.   Seems like a pretty universal statement on the historical laws that govern class relations and consciousness, if you ask me. Of course, there are a tonne of other passages from Lenin's work where he was more vague (perhaps deliberately) as to whether \"'proletarian leadership\" means the leadership of the proletariat or the party that represents the proletariat, but given his overall argument in \"What Is To Be Done?\" and how the USSR actually turned out... I think it's pretty clear what he meant.  >Lmao I never argued for class collaboration. Class collaboration implies the liquidation of the proletariat and its political bodies into the sphere of the bourgeoisie. What matters is the class in command, and that should be the proletariat.  And my point is that the viability of \"proletarian leadership\" within liberal institutions such as the nation-state is not very good, especially when this necessitates cooperation (what you might call collaboration) with capitalist classes, which always leads to the submission of proletarian interests to capital. This is something any socialist should be able to see. [SEP] > I know all this, and my point is anarchists can participate in it without reference to the question of statehood.  Whether or not anarchists reference statehood, thats the ultimate goal of the anti-colonial movement in Palestine (and the rest of the world).  > What action does specifically reference statehood? Only the \"politics of demand\"  Not 'only'. If you really think all anti-imperialist revolutions have just been \"politics of demand\" then I can't really argue that, because you obviously think anything that isn't anarchist and anti-state is some liberal protesting asking to be \"recognized\"  > This is a huge oversimplification and very much feels like an attempt to fit contemporary developments into old theoretical frameworks that don't suit them   If you don't want oversimplifications I can recommend books that go into greater detail. IDK what is so crazy about the fact of semi-feudalism still existing. Look at the Philippines, Afghanistan, pretty much any country dominated by imperialism. These relationships exist. The capitalist mode of production didn't develop in equal ways all across the world at the same time, and remnants of feudalism are common in the global south.  > Really, saying contemporary imperialism blocks \"developments towards industrialisation\" just suggests to me that you haven't actually read much literature on modern geopolitics  You're very good at being condescending but not actually making arguments.   > More to the point I have no idea why you would say that if you apparently knew globalisation is leading to huge industrial growth in urban centres of the developing world? And must have therefore also known that industrial manufacturing is the backbone of many developing economies?  Because theres more to imperialism than what happens in the cities. Plus, its the semi-feudal social structures between the landowning bourgeoisie and imperialist monopoly interests which forces rural populations to labor on the land to repay debts and meet the quotas of landowners, while the outward flow of surplus labor from the countryside to urban labor markets (which are restricted by foreign imperialist monopolies and oligopolies) creates downward pressure on wages which is why we often refer to the proletariat of the global south as \"super-exploited\". The land is prevented from undergoing agrarian reform (which has historically been done by either a free market in land and labor or the collectivization of land and its redistribution) because the maintenance of small plots being managed by poor farmers is beneficial to capitalists' in the imperialist centers who rely on the labor of those in the periphery.  > Sorry, you can't have capitalist exchange without capital. And you especially now can't have global capitalist exchange without global capital  I'm not just talking about capital, or trade, I'm talking about global chains of value transfer which are essentially just lines from the global south to the global north. I'm talking about the exploitation and extraction of value and resources from whole countries by imperialist ones. Thats very different from simply \"trade\".  > Right then. So what did he mean by this?  He's talking about the historic development of socialism as a theory. And he's not wrong, at the time of writing that pretty much all major socialist theoreticians were of the intelligentsia, and workers were mainly only involved in trade unions (the \"exclusively and by their own effort\" clause is very important in this paragraph too, because he's not at all saying that the working class can't do stuff more revolutionary than trade union work). Its not arguing that the intelligentsia should be treated as greater or more revolutionary than the workers, but that this class divide was something that needed to be reckoned with in Revolutionary Russia. But \"What is to be Done?\" is typically not at all a very critical work for actually learning what Leninism is about, and really isn't at all that relevant to this debate thread, so I'm gonna drop it (and suggest you do too).  > And my point is that the viability of \"proletarian leadership\" within liberal institutions such as the nation-state is not very good  The state isn't an institution of liberalism, its an institution of class society. Until class is abolished, and in the necessary period where the proletariat will have to hold power over the bourgeoisie, talking about \"proletarian leadership\" not only makes sense, but is necessary in determining the political line of movements and states.  > cooperation (what you might call collaboration) with capitalist classes, which always leads to the submission of proletarian interests to capital.  It doesn't though. It only does when the leadership of the proletariat is abandoned and is liquidated into the bourgeoisie. Thats what happened in Indonesia. But when the bourgeoisie is kept under the direction of the proletariat and is held in check by a proletarian-led state, the interests of capital can be subsided and liquidated by the interests of the proletariat. Thats basically what happened with the NEP. Its also what happened with the period of New Democracy in China.  I know you don't think those countries are socialist or led by the proletariat, and seeing as how this thread isn't about the history of these states I think its generally a topic we should leave aside for now","target":"condescension"},{"text":"I didn't mean to ever imply that his recording was illegal in any criminal context.  > 2.Saying the SP \"really didn't have a choice\" is asinine.

Do note the wording in the OP.  Then when it gets out of hand (how could it not?) with people posting the guy's phone number and stuff the mods refuse to act. I had to call in reddit's main admins to get the stuff removed (after like 7 hours).  But yeah, making judgment calls to the best of someone's ability (\/u\/yaroberto on the day's matches) makes people antagonistic. Invoking and condoning witchhunts is totally cool.  I know everybody here loves \/u\/Coca_Cola_PR, but the truth of the matter is the dude messed up, saw what he did and then chickened out. The fact that nobody else on the Mod-team jumped in where he maybe had a bad episode doesn't do a lot to restore faith in this subreddit.  The fact that up until as I write this no remaining Mods have distanced themselves from \/u\/Coca_Cola_PR's behavior on that day or have even tried beginning to right his wrongs is just bad moderation. Just bad moderation.  Unbanning \/u\/yaroberto really is the tiniest step imaginable in starting to repair the damage done. I honestly can't believe THAT's what we're debating here. We should be talking about what we can do to make amends with csgolounge. Can you even begin to imagine what \/u\/yaroberto must think of this subreddit?  If you honestly think \/u\/yaroberto is the bad guy here all I can say is maybe get that shoulder looked at, because there seems to be a huge chip on it. The guy sucks at communicating, but at least he has always had the community's best interest at heart.  \/u\/Coca_Cola_PR at least came to his senses at one point. I respect him for that.

It's there for users to vent their frustration at a bizzare call by the staff of lounge.  Yaroberto has shown multiple times how poor his communication skills are. He makes rash decisions in less thoughtout broken english without thinking about how that effects the image of the site. Remember the time he banned the Lounge-Plugin? He called it a phishing attempt, put up a vague message about \"banning\" users and banned tw8 and any threads on it (seem familiar?). He made little if any attempt to reach the creator or talk with the users about it. There is little transparency with the guy. If he's gonna lie and act like a child then he shouldn't be in any position of power and honestly doesn't need to be on this subreddit. He rarely uses it for communicating with the community.  There is nothing to apologize to him about, the acts of a few users (the ones who DOX him and spam his subreddit) do not represent the whole subreddit.

Not go out and make a new forum, ignore the questions everyone wants answered and then have someone else on the site see what he's doing wrong and give a half hearted apology for him. We're all adults here (for the most part) and some people should expect a mutual level of respect for that to happen and its on him to make the first move.  But go ahead, the next time something bad happens see how he responds with his well guided and often direct response to the issues. Like how he handled the LGB v Mystik judgment vs Navi match.

But this is EXACTLY the problem with how men's and women's issues are being presented--as a zero sum. And I fundamentally disagree that it is zero sum. I hear what you're saying in the case of rape prosecution, and that is a special case. But with other issues prominent to feminism (right to choose, wage gap [and please let's not get derailed on whether\/why it is a thing, that is NOT the point here], underrepresentation) and the MRM (custody, incarceration\/sentencing bias, conscription), there isn't a tradeoff. They're separate. Sure, if we increase representation of women, proportionally the representation of men goes down, but if they're still overrepresented, I don't see that as a problem unless the way we increased representation was unjust in the first place--in which case we should be working on fixing the problem more equitably for EVERYONE's interests. I think cases where men's and women's rights are fundamentally in opposition are the minority. If you could show that this is not the case, and that more feminist societies oppress men, you would almost certainly CMV.  >I think making a separate movement makes more sense. It gets attention! It results in posts like yours! But if I went onto r\/feminism and started criticising, I'd be banned (actually that already happened).  The problem is that often it gets the worst KIND of attention. It got mine, in a reasonably positive way, all things considering... But I don't think my experience is normal. I think that most people hear about the MRM and laugh, because the movement has made a mockery out of real complaints. Some of that is because of the extremists, just as with feminism... But it's hard to deny that misogyny is front and center in the MRM. In the public consciousness, the MRM is a far bigger joke than feminism. If the MRM were the source of positive attention, I'd feel differently, but almost everyone I've ever met IRL who has brought up the MRM brought it up as a fringe group on par with the WBC. [SEP] Rape isn't a special case at all. The wage gap falls in the category I'm describing. You can't really say whether the same concept applies to it without getting into why it exists, but to the extent it's women being pressured to work less for family reasons, well, someone has to take care of the family so if you reduce their pressure it will increase pressure on men. If it's direct discrimination, then alleviating that will reduce men's wages. If it's higher up positions (the glass ceiling), then fewer men will be CEOs. Etc.  Custody is another example - more men getting custody means fewer women getting custody. Conscription is too.  By the way, lots of feminist rhetoric acknowledges this. Many feminists say men oppose feminism because they're threatened by it. Why would they be threatened if feminism was gonna be neutral or help them?  > Sure, if we increase representation of women, proportionally the representation of men goes down, but if they're still overrepresented, I don't see that as a problem ...  You're not saying men's and women's interests aren't opposed. You're just saying that in this case you care more about women's interests. Fair enough! It also hurt white people's interests to let black people vote in the South, but sometimes that's just how it goes. I think it denies reality to pretend that's not the case.  > a fringe group on par with the WBC.  It seems to me that feminists give more lip service to men's issues because the MRAs exist, even though people also dislike MRAs. It makes perfect sense this would happen - people don't like MRAs, but the reaction I usually hear is something like \"I sympathize with some of their issues but think they're all nuts.\"  Without the MRAs, those issues don't get mentioned at all, in my experience. Being a feminist and mentioning them usually gets a response of \"stop mansplaining\" or \"stop derailing\" or \"this is a space for women's issues\" or something, and the discussion never reaches a high enough level to get anyone's attention.  EDIT: I should also add, I don't think it's zero sum. There are tradeoffs, but there can still be policies that are overall better than others. \"Zero sum\" and \"can help both sides with no drawbacks\" are two ends of spectrum, and it's in the middle somewhere.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":">The chances are I know way more about video production than you.  Unlikely, given the fact that you think linking to your channel where the most advanced editing I seem to see is cutting from one game clip to another proves some kind of point. Here is a list of multiple different live face swap apps that could be used to knock that video out in an hour or so. Also, the compositing that Ethan does in AE is very basic, so I don't fully understand why you're pulling that out like it's some kind of ultimate trump card. It's not impressive to name drop AE with no context, especially if you think what Ethan's doing in it is some kind of top-level composite work. A lot of Ethan's editing is great, and you can tell that there is a lot of effort put in, but that is not present whatsoever in the Harambe video.  As for the rest of the points you made, while the act of uploading a video takes time depending on your connection, it doesn't take effort, and that's the point I'm making about the Harambe video, it's patently low effort. Also, if it'd take you a long time to make this thumbnail in Photoshop, you're not exactly a wizard with the program.  I'm glad you enjoyed the video, I really am, I like for people to enjoy the things that they enjoy, it's awesome. But regardless of whether the video is bad or not, it is comparatively very low effort. I want the best for H3H3, since they were one of my favorite channels on YouTube a while back, but liking something doesn't make it immune to criticism or speculation about some of the stranger decisions they make. I still think that merging E&H with H3H3 was a mistake, as they make very different content and the merge seems to have lowered the average quality across the board, but again, that's my opinion.  When you make things consistently at a certain degree of quality, people come to expect that sort of quality from the things you make. You set a standard. When you suddenly produce videos with half or lower the production quality because you've got a guaranteed built in audience, it comes across as slacking because you have the ability to.  EDIT: Took a look at some of your other videos, I take back what I said about the editing. A lot of your typography and whatnot is solid. Sorry about that. That being said, you being proficient with that makes me more confused as to how you think face swapping is difficult. [SEP] Did you look at my channel? I did all of the animation myself. I actually do commissions for after effects animations.   I'm not saying the face swapping takes effort. And I never ever said Ethan does top level composite work? Why do you keep making stuff up? Where did I say that? Can you quote me where I even implied that?  I never said that would take me a long time in photoshop either. I said that the whole process would take several hours. I said that it does take a fair amount of work. That's all I said. Stop inferring. It's very very irritating.  > liking something doesn't make it immune to criticism or speculation about some of the stranger decisions they make.  Nothing is immune from criticism. But saying that Ethan made that video just to grab some quick cash (which is what you said) is not criticism; it's completely baseless ad hominem. When you say something like that you're not criticising Ethan's work, you're criticising his character.  Many times I have created things that I thought were good at the time, and then when I get feedback I hate it. It would really upset me to upload something I thought was funny or cool (low effort or not) and get back from my fans \"Wow. Sellout. Just making this video for a quick buck, eh dude?\" which is similar to what you said, if a bit exaggerated.  Look. Sorry if I came across as condescending or whatever. It just upset me to hear someone say something like that about a creator who is really passionate about his work.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"That's not making anything up, that's me speaking(albeit a little subjectively if you really want to get technical) of how the nature of battle threads are. Next.  Once again, this example that you're giving is still not showing me making anything up. But I will reply to it and explain my reasoning behind the whole \"x>y\" argument. Certain characters can have glaring weaknesses and can lose certain battles for a multitude of reasons. These reasons can make a huge difference in the context of a battle. For example, Kakashi beat Obito, right? Now, does this mean that Kakashi would also beat Guy, Naruto, and Killer Bee combined? No, most likely not. But since Kakashi beat Obito(context is apparently irrelevant here), he should be able to do the same thing that Obito did, right? That's exactly where the problem lies in those kinds of lists. I figure, if a character is so absolutely better than another in you eyes, then why not just argue about it using feats and evidence? If you're so sure Madara would win, why haven't you made a solid argument yet?  DMS Kakashi feats are similarly applicable to Obito, considering that Obito was the reason why Kakashi was able to use the DMS. Everything I argue for DMS Obito, I can support with manga feats and I can in fact thoroughly explain why it's applicable if you so wish, just call me out on whatever it is that you doubt. Now, compare this, to the fact that you have no argument whatsoever concerning Madara.   Just as you said I'm guessing, you're guessing right here. The truth is, we can't be certain. But tell me why Kamui wouldn't work? Kamui allows the user to phase through objects as shown various times in the manga, why is Amaterasu an exception. If you can explain why it wouldn't work, then I'll concede this argument, but until then, you have nothing.   Obito doesn't have to be better than Madara at tai, nin, or genjutsu. He only needs Kamui to win, and you still haven't proven that wrong. But even so, Obito is on par with Madara in terms of ninjutsu. I can explain why if you so wish.  First off, Madara can't speed blitz him. A half dead Obito that was being controlled by Black Zetsu was able to block two TSBs, Madara is at most on par with the speed of a TSB or perhaps even slower. As a matter of fact, Obito was faster than Madara in that same chapter as well. Remember when Madara tried to take out his Rinnegan? Obito activated Kamui before he could grab it. Madara cannot speed blitz Obito. And you also seem to keep misunderstanding, Obito is going use Kamui on Madara to kill him. Obito has both eyes, meaning all he has to do is look at Madara for less than a second and the fight's over.   downgraded shinobi skills don't matter in this fight, I don't know why you're brining them up. We're arguing Madara vs DMS Obito. Nothing else, don't bring up any other hypothetical situations for the fight other than that.   Like I said, if you want to debate Hashirama vs. Obito, go make a post about it and send me the link. I will not speak further on this subject here in this thread.   Now, if you would kindly finally construct an argument, I'd be happy to have an actual debate with you.  [SEP] > most likely not.

If you can point to a better set of tenets and principles, feel free to share what they happen to be.

You're touching on an aspect of humanity that's true for some people (i.e., the need by some to belong to one group or another). That's true of every socio-economic spectrum of society, including many within the atheist community. From personal experience, I have never found that most religious believers worship in order to belong to a social group as much as to form closer ties to God. It's a very personal choice. Are there some who worship for social reasons? Yes, but they're missing the point of faith and worship...to worship God and gain spiritual enrichment, not to join social cliques. To expand on this somewhat, most people's religious affiliations are based upon the denominations they are born into. Many people switch denominations as they age, but that's simply because they find that different denominations are a better match for their personal views\/values.  >Christopher Columbus getting lucking and finding land has no bearing on whether or not there is sky monster.

My point is that you're arguing the wrong point: contraceptives vs. the real focus, which is abortion rights. Hitchens' point about men vs. women is that these laws were passed by men and are still debated by men as to what women should do with their bodies. Women should be at least - at least - 50% of the participants. This may not apply so much in the US but in third world countries where men rule and women are denied abortion. As far as contraceptives, your choice to not be on birth control is fine but it's a question of having it be available vs. not being available. Speaking for this country, it annoys me that Viagra is covered under medical insurance but birth control is not (in many cases).  Hitchens was talking about women being saddled with kids (unwanted pregnancies and rape) which hurts their chances of escaping poverty (rape in particular can make you an outcast).

Apropos the 'especially racist for his time' claim, that is so popular these days: What is the basis of this claim? That some modern novelist said so in a blog post? That Joshi once said so?   Compare what Lovecraft said with what his contemporaries said and\u2014more importantly\u2014DID. Have a look at this for historical context:  http  In case you don't know, Lovecraft lived from 1890 to 1937.   Now, nobody would dispute that Lovecraft was no fan of multiculturalism. However, the actual severity of his racism compared to others of his time is greatly exaggerated on a regular basis.   Lovecraft's biological racism was mostly confined to black people. These views, of course, are deplorable. However, it is important to know that they mostly reflected the science of his time. When judging Lovecraft, you may also want to note that Lovecraft expressedly says in one of his letters that he would be the last person to wish black people any harm. Let us be honest: Seen within the context of his time, this sentiment alone would be enough to dismiss your claim. Racist: Yes. Especially racist for his time: No.  By insisting that Lovecraft was especially racist for his time, essentially, what you are doing is to deny an inglorious chapter of Western history: Large parts of the American (and European) public held similar views. You are using Lovecraft as a scapegoat.    As for me 'begging the question'... Where in my original post do I advance a proposition which requires proof is assumed without proof?   To your last point: Of course, it is not bad writing to introduce the thematic center near the beginning of a text. However, that is not what I pointed out in my post. One might propose that TSoI is built around two revelations meant to shock the reader: 1.) The townsfolk are fish people. 2) The narrator is as well.  Now, if we follow the interpretation that fish people are simply a metaphor for immigrants, then the first revelation would appear to fall flat because it is spoiled early on in the passage I quoted.   Either way, the idea to equate the Deep Ones with immigrants does little to advance our understanding of the story. Instead, it has actually caused critics, including Joshi, to struggle to deliver a satisfactory interpretation of the final revelation.  [SEP] >Now, if we follow the interpretation that fish people are simply a metaphor for immigrants, then the first revelation would appear to fall flat because it is spoiled early on in the passage I quoted.  Wrong it isn't a one to one analogy ('equate') nor is it the only thing the story is \"about\" ('simply') nor was anyone arguing that it was, but the idea of interracial marriage (+ interracial sex etc.) being horrible is totally true within the story--in your quote the \"horror\" of interracial marriage (inasmuch as it being stigmatic w\/n the community) is introduced early on as a mundane thing, the horror is intensified when the Other the people of Innsmouth are mixing w. is revealed to be fishpeople and the horror is further intensified when the narrator is discovered they are a product of said horror that's been explored throughout the story. The terror isn't spoiled it is built upon. I think you're plainly wrong to disagree that the horror of interracial marriage isn't present in the story--the horror and actually the twist being used more than once by Lovecraft in other stories (though I couldn't name their titles because I read all of Lovecraft 2 years ago but there's one where a woman I think comes from apes or something).  Wrt. Lovecraft's racism you're probably right. It was my understanding reading something by Joshi a few years ago that Lovecraft was especially racist.  Begging the question, you literally ask a question that goes beyond the logical implications of 85's assertion: 'Explain: Of all the possible interpretations why do you think that would be the best one?' to 'I believe Innsmouth is about interracial marriage.' 'About' meaning almost always 'I think X is one of the things Y is about,' hardly ever 'I think Y is only about X.' Your 'best' seems to imply that 85's stated interpretation is the only one they think because they said in one sentence that they believe something about the text.

[SEP] >I feel like I can't break up with him because no one would like to have the chance of herpes in their genitals from one blowjob you know.  This is a very irrational belief. Remember that more than half of all people have oral hsv1! And on top of that, many people who have it don't know they have it. For the vast majority of people out there, having a partner with oral hsv1 is a non-issue. It is *not* the case that people with oral hsv1 have any problem finding partners because of having oral hsv1.  >Idk I feel like I probably have it genitally.. hopefully I don't.   It is *extremely* unlikely that you also have it genitally. Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location, you become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time. This is because after you are first infected with herpes, your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).  There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.  >I suffer from depression and chronic anxiety so finding someone else at the moment or even the thought of dating and getting myself or there is not a possibility.  I see. That can be very challenging. Are you working with a therapist at all? That can sometimes help very substantially. It is very likely that your depression and anxiety are influencing your current mindset regarding oral hsv1, and your beliefs about your relationship options as well. You can talk with a therapist about anything. Whether it be your depression and anxiety in general, or oral hsv1 specifically. Some people who have never been to a therapist before think \"oh, I could never talk about 'that'! It's too personal and embarrassing\". But those things are exactly the kinds of thing that therapists are professionally trained to talk with you about.  >He's verbally abusive sometimes.  I'm glad that you're aware of this. It's important to understand how harmful verbal abuse can be. It can be even more harmful then physical abuse. It can contribute very substantially to a victim's depression and anxiety, and prolong it. Chronic verbal abuse (ie that continues over a significant period of time) can also change the victim's perceptions of themselves. It can cause them to lose their frame of reference and objectivity, and instead their thinking can become very negatively skewed and biased (against themselves) without their realizing it. It is likely part of the reason that you feel that \"dating and getting myself out there is not a possibility\".  There is an excellent book I would recommend to you on verbal abuse: *The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How to recognize it and how to respond*, by Patricia Evans. Here is a link to it on Amazon: LINK. I suspect you would find this book very informative and helpful.  Please consider working with a therapist if you aren't already.

You may as well say \"Something\" instead of God and it would apply all the same.  And, you are correct. I would largely discount those stories because human beings are incredibly irrational. Our minds are beautiful at filling in holes in stories - I'd say a very defining characteristic of our species is the inborn curiosity that drives us to understand ourselves and our universe. Out of that curiosity came explanations for reality that were, at the time, inexplicable. The sun was Apollo; hybrids of creatures born out of imagination became a pantheon; God is love and genocidal. The list goes on and on and on...  ... but it's far, far more likely that people are simply creating the reality they wish to experience because the thought of not being born of purpose is frightening.

From a non-Christian and non-atheist perspective, that's what those subs are on their official heading and what they'd like to be, but not how \/r\/TrueChristianity or \/r\/Christian are in practice.  \/r\/Christianity is more the community for Christians. Reason being is that I see a lot of non-discussion threads that'd be considered completely rude and disruptive in a discussion setting, and these threads are very successful. Headings like, \"Praise the LORD!\" or \"Jesus is LORD!\" with content like, \"He is!\" and upvotes for miles. Meanwhile regular discussion comments can be harshly criticized (not discussed) and censored by vote manipulation. Here is one where I was downvoted 18 times, passive-aggressively harassed, accused (\"why you mad, bro?\" provoking with Christian overtones), and the like for saying that I didn't understand why martyrdom was righteous and why that was. That didn't contribute to the discussion in the opinion of readers, because the discussion isn't the subject of martyrdom, but how Christian norms are great.  Also there have been occasions where I was surprised with mod action, because I was mistaken for an atheist, taken out of context, and shaken down for \"disrespecting Christianity\" (basically, not advocating it, or for viewing it from an historic lens as a faith).

I've been threatened here for less, so I generally keep it to myself and let folks believe what they want about themselves and their communities.  But this isn't a place to a forum to discuss Christianity. Discussions happen, but they're tightly regulated by several tiers of influence starting at the community level and escalating to moderation and expulsion.   You can either be neutral (generally speaking, as there are times you can't as the mods\/users will add tone based on their spiritual insecurity), or advocate Christianity. If you're not \"respectful\" to the subject matter, you're out. That's not a place of discussion, that's a community.

If you arrive at 10am, you can probably make your way to the front eventually, with some effort and hustle ( bc there are multiple \"checkpoints\" you go through, as I explain later.)   Don't listen to the guy that said one or two hours. Check out the line in my video. In my second and third rally's, almost everyone in the front were people who missed the first rally bc they showed up late. Some even 5 hrs early and missed it. Again, check that fucking line out!

I definitely brought snacks and water and even ordered a few pizzas for my new friends. Like I said, no big deal if you get up to grab them.   Go to the bathroom before you enter the final hall, bc you will not want to move from your spot.

Run to the best spot! Out run the grannies you made friends with all day long, run for yourself and your experience! Now your focus is on enjoying the rally and getting that special signature!   Trump always walks around the half circle in front of the stage and signs gear. He will have his own sharpie so don't bring one. Also, BRING SOMETHING MAGA to get signed. If you bring a hat or a trump book or something \"special\" like that, he WILL sign it. The secret service is often annoyed at how slow he goes signing things.

Seriously.  In baseball 3 outfielders play. If Gardner and Ellsbury are 2 of those then one does not replace the other.  I don't know how to more plainly put that.  And, again, you can make your comparison. I am telling you that it isn't the best comparison and offering an alternative.   You seem to make no real arguments here. Excuse me if I'm wrong but I'm trying to simplify your arguments so that maybe we can figure out where are are confusing each other:  >Cano can be compared directly to Ellsbury.  I offered an alternative approach that would more accurately determine the net WAR gained\/lost from these two contracts. I feel like we are arguing over one another so I am not going to repeat myself.  >categorically wrong and you're categorically right. I think both sides have merit, albeit one more than the other, but it's not fair to treat the other side as if it had zero value.  I don't actually agree with this. I honestly think comparing two different FAs at different positions is wrong. Also, regarding the straw man claim: I claimed this because he was manipulating my argument and taking portions of my argument and going SEE. Without context. This is a fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. Thus, straw man argument (I essentially stole the definition from Google).  >I have a hard time accepting how you posit, at one point, that $\/WAR is a widely used tool, but cannot bear any comparison of Ellsbury to Cano (especially when you go into WAR increase\/decrease by position). If we're playing in the universe of WAR, we understand the idea of comparing two different players at different positions, which is exact and expressed purpose of the statistic.   The argument does not center around WAR. It centers around the fact that one player does not directly replace another here. It would be different if one 1B replaces another 1B - you can easily show the change in WAR over position.  Maybe opening this up in a hypothetical will make this easier:  Ellsbury + Infante or Cano + Soriano.   Now we have players at both positions. Now we can compare total WAR.   Comparing Cano to Ellsbury completely ignores the fact that these two players are not slotting in for one another. This is pretty simple.  > For example, the Yankees have made plenty of signings that were rooted in \"this guy can give us a ton of merchandising revenue\" -- just look at the incentives in the A-Rod contract, that was clearly the motivation for much of the mammoth contract, not his on-field value.   The Yankees made most of these signings in a time without a strong luxury tax or decentivizing measure. These times are no more.   The Yankees live in a world where they believe the cap matters. This is essential to understanding why they said no to Cano. You cannot compare the past anymore.   >Top analysts also directly compare Cano's and Ellsbury's contracts. I still think we can discuss it, though. A better approach than $\/WAR, I think, is considering the $\/WAR of players gained through FA, and cut out guys who are still in arbitration. I have seen this statistic floated calculated, and it puts most contracts into a completely reasonable light, and I also agree with the reasoning behind it. I can go and find it if you'd like, but I was trying for brevity.  Yes please. If it comes from a reliable source or has data to back it up even better.  [SEP] > Alright I can't explain this any simpler. Seriously.  I understood your argument, but you have been talking like this and it is frustrating and comes across as condescending -- makes me want to discontinue this altogether. I believe I addressed that in my post, and communicated that this is not the only way to look at a contract; it is a top-down view, and it only works with knowledge of what the Yankees will do, or assumptions on FAs that could have been acquired. You can analyze contracts outside of that framework and they can be reasonable. For instance, your methodology requires assumptions and knowledge about comparisons of positions that only make sense after we know what the Yankees will do or would have done, which is a retrospective argument, and only really works when you analyze it after the entire postseason. If the Yankees signed Cano, they would not have pursued the same contracts; your argument assumes several specific signings and positional improvements, which is a fatalistic approach. At the end, it may not be an upgrade from Ellsbury to Gardner, as Ellsbury being signed improves the chances that Gardner is no longer on the team.  In this way, one can simply argue that, in the middle of a fluid roster midseason, every piece of the lineup is not position by position improvement, but simply assets for a cost. Following this reasoning, it is not only reasonable but obvious to compare Cano and Ellsbury, as in the middle of the offseason, they are just money for value, regardless of the position. That you believe that you have the \"most accurate\" version of comparison, I believe, is a little much; that's a pretty heft contention, and I think, is reasonably arguable at the very least.  Also, the Yankees are spending as if there is no cap this offseason. My examples were not to say that A-Rod was a good comparison, it was the elucidate that clubs have different motivations for signing contracts outside of straight on the field value. Even assuming the Yankees are staying below the cap, my point is still very relevant.","target":"condescension"},{"text":"Yeah, I just couldn't believe the way Pettis softly and anticlimactically armbarred him in the center of the octagon in the beginning of the first.

You are correct when you say that it is \"putting the aura to use in order to act.\" However, it is only truly Hatsu when the aura materializes in order to carry out the will of the user, and it always abides by certain conditions. Gon tossing a ball of aura was not a Hatsu. It was an exercise useful in developing an Emission Hatsu, but the technique itself was not Hatsu. It is not Hatsu until you assign it a particular set of instructions, in which case, again, it always abides by a certain conditions.  I mean, your interpretation is nice and all, but where is your source for all this? It just seems like something you came up with. You have to talk according to the manga for it to be acceptable. Find a page where it says it's mandatory to have conditions in hatsu, and then it'll be acceptable.  > Killua's thunder palm condition would be that the Hatsu also hurts the user. Killua had to build up a tolerance to electricity as a prerequisite and voluntarily causes pain to himself every time he uses it. Kurapika's would depend on what each chain does, as each of his chain would warrant an individual Hatsu.  The Killua example was brought up by yourself. But if you now think it has conditions, no problem, I'll put it aside. But about Kurapika, my point remains the same. The only conditions Kurapika has mentioned, are for the special functions of his chains. If he was fine with just using his chains as whips, that was a hatsu without conditions.  > Sure, hypnosis can have quick results and precise control. Think the Imperius curse from Harry Potter.

Let me explain: When you say you \"know\" how to play a game, there are actually several levels of knowing:  1. Knowing the rules and how to not make invalid\/illegal moves. 2. Knowing fundamentals (how to kick a ball, how to throw a ball, now to do dribbling etc). There is also a level 2.5 that would consist of knowing pre-defined combinations of fundamentals. 3. Knowing tactics (how to chose the best fundamentals for each moment to archive a short term gain or objective) 4. Knowing strategy (how to chose the best tactics to archive the major game goals)  For example in soccer, the players (individually and as a team) are responsible for all four levels. The coaches in soccer are afforded very little input to players during the game, so their role is mostly limited to just gran-strategy, which is defining guidelines for the players to make strategy decisions themselves in real-time in the middle of the game. During game play each player needs to be constantly making tactics and strategy decisions, defining his(hers) own positioning taking in consideration the positioning of all his team, the opposing team and the ball. In this context the player with the ball momentarily defines the tactics and strategy of the whole team, but even that doesn't mean that the other players are just being directed, instead they have to use their awareness to open up new tactics and strategies by using his(her) positioning; and to recognize tactics and strategies being open by other players and changing yours to match theirs.  On American-Football on the other hand, the \"players\" have very little autonomy to make tactical decisions and (with very few exceptions) almost no autonomy at all to make strategic decisions. Instead, the coach(es) makes all the strategic decisions and the \"players\" are simply told what to do and consequently also told what their teammates will do, they are responsible only for executing pre-rehearsed combinations of fundamentals, spending most of their time thinking at most at level 2.5 and just some times doing some basic tactics decisions. The real player on American-Football is the coach, the people in the field are just very very complex chess pieces. [SEP] Yo have a flawed understanding of American Football if you believe this. Also, basketball isn't a sport where coaches draw up every play. Maybe a few possessions at the end of games are scripted and a few coming out of timeouts, but generally in the NBA players are given the freedom to move the ball and try to create opportunities.   Also, this:  > In the USA the \"players\" are not real players, instead they are just complex game pieces that are played by a coach (or team of coaches) who actually make most of the tactics and strategy decisions.  is incredibly condescending to read as an American. WTF our \"players\" aren't real players? What because they aren't all coaches on the field??

Or, if you're going to be parked at a work site all day anyway, you can charge the vehicle with an ordinary outlet. And supply will meet demand. There weren't always gas stations everywhere. As gas cars started going everywhere, people opened up businesses to support them. The same can, will, and IS happening with electric charging stations.

Mythology is stories, and there can be multiple \"disagreeing\" stories, and it's not a problem, because mythology is meant to be understood, not believed.  The problem with theology is that is says X is true and therefore not-X is false. This means it contradicts other theologies, and since it's all just based on feels anyway, it eventually leads to cognitive dissonance when the feels change. That's unhealthy, in my view.

It certainly is semantics, but I think the first statement creates a misconception about the limits of current scientific knowledge. The second statement can sound condescending if you're a jerk about it, but as long as the explainer cares that the asker is just trying to learn, and the asker recognizes that some things have no simple answers, I don't really see any downside.

Can you provide a \"why\" question that can be satisfactorily answered according to your standard in any context, without assumptions? Under what circumstances is a \"why\" question really a \"why\" question, and when is it a \"how\" question? We're back to semantics.   The \"why\" questions that science cannot answer are questions about purpose. But such questions can be phrased less ambiguously as \"what\" questions, instead... For example, the common question, \"Why am I here?\" can be rephrased as \"What is my purpose?\" The first question could mean multiple things - it could be asking what led to my current state, or my existence at all (in which case I can actually start to answer that question), or it could be asking about my purpose in being here, in which case science and empiricism have nothing to say.   Bringing it back to the original question, if the OP is asking, \"to what end does the photon have no mass?\", then physics has nothing to say on the matter, because science doesn't confer purpose, it simply describes. On the other hand, if the OP instead means, \"what causes the photon to be massless?\" we can start to answer that question just fine. The interrogative adverbs of the english language are far too ambiguous to set one on a pedestal; any question I can think of (although there might be exceptions) could be asked in many ways using different words. The correct meaning of the terrible cliche \"science can't answer why\" is all about purpose, not semantics. If \"why\" is being used to infer purpose, then that question can't be answered; but plenty of \"why\" questions do not have that meaning!

In that sense, I view an apology maybe as a way to admit to a wrong, but not necessarily as an admission of malice. I expect apologies for honest mistakes too. And the second axis where what you say is wrong is that you talk about a topic, while I talk about what you are saying and how you are saying stuff. You are free to talk about racism (the topic), but if you say that all Mexicans are rapists (\"what\" you say) or if you call me a cunt talking the finer points of geopolitics (\"how\" you say it) I do believe you did something wrong.   > I don't know of any 1st world country that punishes people for insulting or talking about something that some find offensive.  Again, you are ever so subtly and unintentionally twisting what I'm saying :) You gave a definition of \"attack\" that purely involved physical acts. I countered by pointing out that this definition is too narrow and that indeed most countries have laws that also punish non-physical violence. Think about mobbing for example, or (some forms of) stalking.  If you are unhappy with the usage of the term \"violence\" or \"attack\" for these, I am happy to substitute them. But the fact is, that most countries recognize by law, that you can cause harm to other people without physically interacting with them.  > Which is why laws have nothing to do with the bars I set myself. My bars are set based on rationality derived from evidence and logical thought.  But then you are agreeing, that the laws are not enough and not a justification not to have a CoC? Because, again, the context in which I said what you responded too was you claiming, that conferences don't need a CoC, because there are already the laws which also apply to this conference. [SEP] > I still expect A to apologize to B, because I want it to learn that it was wrong indeed and to acknowledge the fact that it accepted that it was wrong. In that sense, I view an apology maybe as a way to admit to a wrong, but not necessarily as an admission of malice.  But the thing is, you're equating my intellect to that of a learning child so you are being condescending. You are also in fact saying that I did something wrong and I should apologise for it, even though all I did was air my opinion on a topic that I was discussing.  If my opinion is that all Mexicans are racist then how can you say I'm doing something wrong by telling you that's my opinion? The opinion may be wrong but the sharing of it is not. It is in fact the sharing of it that allows you to debate it and change the person's mind. You are talking about instilling fear in someone airing their opinion like that, when it's actually beneficial to everyone if they do air their opinion so that the debate can get to the core of what's in the person's mind. Like we already established, you believe they are child-like in their thoughts and you are superior, therefore you condescendingly wish to teach them how to behave and in this case it's to shut off their opinion.  There was a time when I may have been killed for saying I don't believe in Jesus, you are coming from the perspective of being in the camp that supports that. You may not agree with being killed for it, but you, at the time, would have agreed that what I was saying is wrong and I should apologise, as according to popular belief, not believing in Jesus was absolutely unimaginable. Which is essentially the same mindset as the people who take the punishment further. Both of you don't like my opinion so you want me to be punished for it and both of you feel superior in intellect and knowledge so you believe you should have precedence over the situation.  Do you see my point here? The popular opinion now is that racism is bad, which is good (in my opinion). However, I don't feel superior in intellect and\/or knowledge of others who decide to voice their opinion in a discussion. If they literally say \"all mexicans are rapists\", I'm not going to ask them to apologise. I'll be happy that they voiced their opinion openly, regardless of how idiotic it may sound to me. Now if I am involved in the discussion I can actually discuss a core part of what's going through their mind. The way you're talking about addressing it, you are shutting off any discussion of it, which is dangerous. Shutting off discussion of it is not going to lead to progress in that person's mind.  A controversial view I hold at the moment is that all drugs should be legalised and regulated. There are an awful lot of people who may come from your style of thinking who would not want me to say something like that openly because it's absolutely unthinkable and could I imagine the damage it would cause. Do you not see that? I'm not talking about your stance on that topic by the way, just the example I'm portraying.  > But then you are agreeing, that the laws are not enough and not a justification not to have a CoC? Because, again, the context in which I said what you responded too was you claiming, that conferences don't need a CoC, because there are already the laws which also apply to this conference.  Not necessarily. I merely said that because you seemed to think I set my morality based on laws and that is not true. I don't agree with all laws that are in place, in fact I think there are a lot of laws which are holding back the progression and safety of humans, e.g the war on drugs.","target":"condescension"},{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I do feel defeated.

And if I did, then I'd personally stop myself before I get \"tipsy\". I drink alcohol because of the flavour and rich traditional history (I'm half German, from a region that's made wine and for over a thousand years). Having been actually tipsy and high before, the two are not even remotely compatible. Being \"tipsy\" or \"warm\" from a bit of alcohol is barely an altered state of mind compared to being full on high from weed. Everyone is different, but the point is you should do your best to not get into an altered\/intoxicated state of mind. So if slightly \"tipsy\" is too intoxicated for you, then don't drink to that point.   2 - Be honest with yourself, how many people do you actually know that smoke just a tiny amount to \"relax\" and then put the weed away because they don't want to get high. Don't kid yourself man. I know most Americans don't have a good example of calm casual drinking, because the culture here seems to be about getting hammered all the time. But being originally from Europe, I know endless people that drink responsibly. Counter that with weed usage here in North America, I've never EVER seen anyone use weed in a way that I would consider \"responsible\" (except for medically). I used to sell drugs before I cleaned up my sinful life (small then wholesale). Weed was the least harmful thing I sold yet I saw it destroy plenty of lives. Mental addiction to weed is very real, and it absolutely has semi-permanently changed the minds of 80% of people that I know who are on it. That's something I have to live with, knowing I was the source for their current issues and dysfunction. Nobody can tell me weed is \"100% harmless\", or that people use it very responsibly. Maybe if they had started using weed at 20+, but most of these people started out real young and their minds are basically mush now (at least to my standards of what I expected from a smart and function human).   3 - I've known PLENTY of people who got violent while on weed. Every single time there was a problem that needed to get dealt with with violence (things which I have and continue to repent for), everyone around me smoked weed before we grabbed weapons to do what we thought we needed to do. Sometimes drinking too, but EVERY time it was weed. Once I got out of that world, I realized it was to drown out our conscience. At the time we saw it as hyping us up to \"put in work\".   4 - I admit my opinion is also because I'm a convert from a charasmatic Jamaican non-denominational church, where weed usage was high and the excuses for the drug were constant. As was the dysfunction it brought to the church. So I'm just being a typical convert that is over-the-top Orthodox. But I do stand by my opinion which is backed by Scripture, the Apostles, the Church father's, and Church rules. I see absolutely no way in which getting high is productive for a pious Orthodox Christian, who is aiming to achieve theosis. [SEP] > I don't get a tipsy feeling from one glass of wine.   You may not feel it, but it's scientifically proven that even a small amount of alcohol impairs judgment, reflexes, and responsiveness. But even if you personally do not feel impaired, I think this belies your initial claim that \"most\" people do not drink to get drunk. Most people DO drink to at least achieve tipsiness, not for some kind of historical appreciation. XD I lived in Bavaria for a while. I know this is true of Germans as well as Americans. I saw plenty of perpetually drunk Europeans in my time there.   >Be honest with yourself, how many people do you actually know that smoke just a tiny amount to \"relax\" and then put the weed away because they don't want to get high. Don't kid yourself man.  Don't be condescending. I know lots of people who just get high to relax and are a lot less impaired than people who drink. That may not be your experience, but it seems like your experience is pretty extreme and not really representative of the general experience.   >Nobody can tell me weed is \"100% harmless\", or that people use it very responsibly.  Nobody is saying that it is 100% harmless. But I think it is just clearly less harmful than alcohol and don't see how you can be okay with alcohol and totally against weed. It makes no sense. Alcohol destroys lives in a much more significant way than weed. And you want to talk brain damage? Long term heavy alcohol use can leave you basically catatonic. And nobody dies from a single night of smoking too much.  > admit my opinion is also because I'm a convert from a charasmatic Jamaican non-denominational church, where weed usage was high and the excuses for the drug were constant.   Yeah, I can tell you have some particular hang-ups about weed informing your opinions. If you don't like weed, that's fine.

The usefulness of this term is that is specifies the brand of condescension being used. It also encompasses reference to the past tendency for this condescension to be considered justifiable by both men and women. I think that's the value in naming it accordingly - it can mock a past that has outlived it's welcome, and stun the argument into a new perspective.

A form of social progress through humor\/satire and it's strength to effect appropriate shamming.  On another note - the best examples I'm coming up with in my head for how it can be used appropriately on a female perpetrator, relate to misjudgement of knowledge base (with prejudice factoring in) - a sort of overreliance on logic at the expense of empathy in an exchange - and mimicking behavior of associates affected by the behavior, second-hand (shit rolling downhill in a business environment).

There is nothing logical in it; it's simply an accusation of someone having a particular stance or motivation - one which you couldn't possibly determine without them explicitly stating it.  So if someone is trying to make an argument to someone who isn't grasping their point, an accusation of \"mansplaining\" fully derails and negates any point they were going to make. The fact that it's a gendered insult means it is capable of silencing and delegitimizing male voices. I'm not cool with that (not cool with silencing any group), personally.  I also think it's of little value in that even if someone is sexist, that doesn't negate any point they were making. That's an ad hominem attack, and it has no place in a rational discussion.

Just to clarify, I don't mean to come across as condescending or holier-than-thou or anything of the sort.   >I just think that you're overlooking the fact that you will now always be shifting attributes, as there's no reason not to.  I don't agree. Mana was never a limiting factor for Morphing before (unless you're against a mana burn hero such as AM, in which case you've probably already lost the game). If anything, I think it's more limiting now since his int has been heavily reduced. This means you can be much less aggressive in lane, especially in mid lane (but it also applies to safelane Morph), which is where I loved to play Morph a few patches ago (Mid Morph only works when the lineup is right, and the meta hasn't been good for it for some time now.).   In regards to shifting attributes, you only need to do that when absolutely necessary. A good Morphling will stay as low on strength (and therefore health) while remaining alive. This gives you the most right click and nuke damage, as well as a lot of armor. The challenge becomes staying alive and knowing when to shift, and when to stop. Very rarely did I run out of mana during a fight unless they had manaburn of some sort, or unless I was very low going into a fight. Silences, nukes and AA are the real enemies of Morphling. Manaburn used to be a concern but honestly versus a support Morph I don't think manaburn even does much in regards to winning the game.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"It's easier to ask questions.

Rather, it is an anti-elitist revolt led by an elite \u2014 a coup by one set of public schoolboys against another.  >I went to university with both sets, and with hindsight I watched Brexit in the making. When I arrived at Oxford in 1988, David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove had just left the place. George Osborne and the future Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Daniel Hannan were all contemporaries of mine.   >I wasn\u2019t close to them, because politically minded public schoolboys inhabited their own Oxford bubble. They had clubs like the Bullingdon that we middle-class twerps had never even heard of. Their favourite hang-out was the Oxford Union, a kind of children\u2019s parliament that organises witty debates. A sample topic: \u201cThat sex is good\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but success is better\u201d, in 1978, with Theresa May speaking against the motion. May is now running for Tory leader without the usual intermediate step of having been Union president, though her husband Philip, Gove and Johnson did all hold that post. (Beautifully, Gove campaigned for Johnson\u2019s election in 1986.)  >You could recognise Oxford Union \u201chacks\u201d by the suits they wore, though none took it as far as Rees-Mogg, a rail-thin teenager who promenaded along Broad Street dressed like a Victorian vicar with an umbrella. Three times a year, when the Union elected new officers, the hacks would go around town tapping up ordinary students with the phrase, \u201cMay I count on your vote?\u201d The traditional climax of a Union election was one Etonian backstabbing another for the presidency.  >It\u2019s no coincidence that the Houses of Parliament look like a massive great Gothic public school. That building is a magnet for this set. Whereas ordinary Britons learn almost no history at school except a UK-centric take on the second world war (as evidenced in the Brexit debate), the Union hacks spent their school years imbibing British parliamentary history. Their heroes were great parliamentarians such as Palmerston, Gladstone and Churchill. I don\u2019t think most Union hacks dreamed of making policy. Rather, Westminster was simply the sort of public-school club where they felt at home \u2014 or in the case of middle-class wannabes like Gove, aspired to feel at home.  >Their chief interest was oratory. From age six they had been educated above all to speak and write well. After Oxford, Union hacks usually found jobs in communications: Cameron went into PR, while Gove, Johnson and Hannan became journalists churning out the kind of provocative essays that are valued at Oxford. Osborne applied to do likewise at the Economist but was turned down at interview by my FT colleague Gideon Rachman. Only Rees-Mogg went into finance, possibly because his dad had already been editor of the Times.  >The autumn I started university, Margaret Thatcher gave her legendary anti-European \u201cBruges speech\u201d, and this set began obsessing about Brussels. Ruling Britain was their prerogative; they didn\u2019t want outsiders muscling in. Tory \u201cEuroscepticism\u201d is in part a jobs protection scheme akin to Parisian taxi drivers opposing Uber.  >The public schoolboys spent decades trying to get British voters angry about the EU. But as Gove admitted to me in 2005, ordinary voters never took much interest. Perhaps they didn\u2019t care whether they were ruled by a faraway elite in Brussels or ditto in Westminster. And so the public schoolboys focused the Brexit campaign on an issue many ordinary Britons do care about: immigration. To people like Johnson, the campaign was an Oxford Union debate writ large. Once again, their chief weapons were rhetoric and humour. In Britain, humour is used to cut off conversations when they threaten either to achieve emotional depth or to get boring or technical. Hence Johnson\u2019s famous, \u201cMy policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it\u201d, a line that doesn\u2019t seem quite so funny now.  \u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009  >The moment Brexit was achieved, Johnson and Hannan airily informed Britons that immigration would continue after all. No wonder, because the public schoolboys don\u2019t care about immigration. Whether Poles and Bangladeshis live in unfashionable English provincial towns is a matter of supreme indifference to them.  >The public schoolboys turned out to have no plan for executing Brexit. I\u2019m guessing they considered this a boring governance issue best left to swotty civil servants. Johnson actually spent the Sunday after Brexit playing cricket. In the great public-school tradition, he was a dilettante \u201cwinging it\u201d.  >Now Britain seems headed for recession. When I mentioned this in an email to a privately educated Oxford friend, he chastised me: \u201cYou seem unduly concerned about short-term financial impacts. This is a victory for democracy.\u201d I see what he means. If you make \u00a3200,000 a year, a recession is just an irritation. But if you make \u00a320,000, it\u2019s a personal crisis, and if you now make \u00a315,000, then soon you may be struggling to feed your children.  >Anyway, the public schoolboys have already moved on to the Tory leadership election. \u201cMay I count on your vote?\u201d What fun!
