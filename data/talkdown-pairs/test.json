The average Trump voter makes about $75k per year. That's not rich but it's certainly not poverty. They're angry because they see us as condescending and exclusionary. They conflate \"coastal liberals\" with an insufferable and not that liberal 0.1% of left-leaning people who live on the coasts. It's like they think that everyone in Manhattan has access to this romantic-comedy life that they've been deprived of, and of course that isn't remotely true.   My theory is that our visible, not-that-liberal cultural elite is permitted to exist by the economic elite because it makes the left look bad to have a bunch of smug, elitist, and largely ineffective assholes represent liberalism.

Maybe they can't build great decks every time, but not everybody has the time to learn these things. It would be completely different if the bot made decisions for them- that would actually be taking the skill out of it. But even some of the best players use HA, and sometimes the best decision is not to listen to it, as it isn't perfect. So even with those using it, they won't be building optimally.   And while there is definitely a difference between watching someone play and using software, I don't really understand where you would draw the line. You say that looking at tier lists is bad, too, but isn't that different? It doesn't take into account your current deck comp or anything. What if a youtuber cites a HA score as a reason to pick a certain card over another? Picking that card in a similar situation would be indirectly because HA reccomended it.   The reason why I think HA is okay in comparasin to p2w is specifically because it is free. If it cost money I really don't think I would be, it would just be people paying for an informational advantage. But in its current state it's free and public access. And I don't think it entirely closes the skill gap either-a casual player will usually be worse off in arena, both in drafting and in the actual battle than someone who has time to play- and I'm okay with that. HA closes the gap that I think matters the most- the information gap. Instead of requiring a large quantity of monetary input from a player to be able to test every card in each class in each deck, HA allows players to get that for free. What it doesn't come with is the actual skill needed to pilot the deck in matches or the knowledge of proper deck construction which it can sometimes advocate against.  And I hate the way downvoting is used these days. I don't know how many times I've seen it repeated but I'll say it again.

I'm the same way, and I've enjoyed this quite a bit.  >Maybe they aren't just as bright gameplay wise  And so I think they deserve to lose more because of it.  >but not everybody has the time to learn these things.  This also applies to losing other things. As per my working example, I don't have time to learn all the tier 1 decklists in constructed, so when I run into one I'm not sure of their decklist. This puts me at a disadvantage because I lack the time to learn something. Drafting is the same thing, if you are worse because you lack the time to learn it, that's a you problem.  > sometimes the best decision is not to listen to it, as it isn't perfect  This is a strong argument, but you're also giving up some ground I don't think you can afford to. You're admitting that drafting is a part of what makes a good player good. If drafting is a part of that, then any outside help artificially increases your chance to win against an opponent who did not receive that outside help. It should not be the standard for the community that \"well a large part of the community all get the same help\" because it decreases the effect of the players drafting skill by leveling the playing field. You've reduced the number of meaningful drafting decisions, and therefore decreased how much skill is involved and therefore INCREASED how much RNG decides games.  > I don't really understand where you would draw the line.  I'm a bit of a hardliner on this actually. While I understand that netdecking is inevitable, I wish that NO ONE did it. It's the reason the meta gets so stale so quickly, we have an army of thousands all optimizing roughly the same lists, and a consensus is reached pretty quickly.  Just imagine it, a world where everyone played their own homebrew decks. Deckbuilding would be a much more important skill in hearthstone, and the meta would be so varied. If people didn't have easy access to their winrates, more people would stick with wackier decks for longer. It would be closer to a fighting game, where people have a favourite character but that the individual playing the game would have the biggest impact on the victor. I can't hammer home the point enough, that the more you reduce the meaningful choices a player can make, the more you increase the effects of RNG. HA irrefutably reduces the number of meaningful choices in any given draft.  >If it cost money I really don't think I would be, it would just be people paying for an informational advantage.   I will concede right away that a monetary cost is so far and away a bigger and more important hurdle than what I'm going to relate it to, but it's a 'proof of concept' if you will. Because HA ISN'T free. While it is free monetary, it requires that you know about HA first and foremost, it costs space on my computer with that shitty bloatware Overwolf, and it costs us deckbuilding as a skill in arena, the DRAFT MODE. Draft modes are supposed to ESPECIALLY highlight deckbuilding as a PRIMARY skill instead of secondary, and as I've explained, HA reduces it significantly. Even though you're right, it isn't right every time, it still reduces the number of decisions from (admittedly not 30 because some cards are auto-select) 20ish to 5ish.   >I don't think it entirely closes the skill gap either  I don't think it does either, but I think it DOES close the skill gap, which means more instances of the better player losing. That is enough of a negative for me to be opposed, even though I am often the worse player.  > What it doesn't come with is the actual skill needed to pilot the deck in matches  True, but a better deck will win more games on average than a worse deck, no matter the skill of the person piloting it.

So they're right. They were non-parents before they were parents and they didn't understand before either. This is much like when a parent tells a child that they shouldn't rush to grow up because they'll miss being a kid.

It's just like any other experience that can't accurately be described unless experienced directly.   riiight, so no amount of connection with any other life, pet, friend, teacher, brother, mother, father, uncle, etc can compare with what a parent feels for their child? does that mean the kids themselves don't have that feeling, seeing as the kid does not have the massive reconfiguration to look after their parents and love them till death?   i understand very well, more than you can imagine, the human behaviour of parenting. which is why when you arrogantly presume to tell me that me what i can and can't \"know\" it makes you sound rather condescending without any real basis.  do you presume to tell adoptive parents they don't feel the same way about their kids as birth-parents? do you presume to tell non-parents, that their choice not to have kids was a mistake?   you presume a lot, and i don't see any reason why a parent that gave birth has any entitlement to a very well understood set of behaviours tat billions of people have done in the past, and billions more will do in the future. it's not a unique experience, it's simply a personal one that has meaning for each parent, but while the meaning is personal, the experience that produces it is very much the same for most people. it's simply how the parents perceive the experience that will seem unique to them, and hence the arrogance of telling other people \"you don't know\".   tell me, does one parent tell the other \"you don't know what my unique experience is like\" ? or are all parents qualified in saying they share the same experience and they are not unique?   you don't know much about what's it's like to have many experiences, but you can learn about them and extrapolate the make-up of the experience using other experiences. it's the basis of learning and it's how we make educated decisions about what to do. we are born without experience except the knowledge in our DNA to start us off (mimicry, how to learn, autonomous systems, etc). how did you decide to do so many things in your life is you \"can't know without doing it\" ?","target":"condescension"},{"text":"> What's wrong with my own opinion?

If it becomes a standalone tech it absolutely will replace JavaScript in a lot of ways. Sure JavaScript won't get removed completely from browsers for legacy reasons, but few informed people will choose to use it.  1. Doesn't really matter since it's a compile target, so it's no worse than ASM which everyone relies on all the time.  2. That's a bad argument, JS on the backend only exists and is only still used because of JS on the frontend. More code reuse and less learning required. If JS's frontend popularity dropped so would it's backend popularity.   It seems like you don't understand that WASM is a compile target, WASM does not cost developer time, besides the initial creation and maintenance of the compiler from your language of choice to WASM.  It's actually quite funny that you trot out the \"we'd all be using ASM\" line, because we ARE, we do all use ASM for everything under the covers (well machine code but whatever), even for non-performance-sensitive tasks. Just like in the long run we will all be using WASM in the browser, just via a compiler or interpreter.   Like seriously this confuses me greatly, does no one on this subreddit get that WASM is a compile target and almost no one will write it directly? It will be a great thing to use for all kinds of web tasks assuming you have a compiler from your language of choice, and I know Haskell, Rust, C, Java, C# and C++ all either have working WASM compilers or are currently developing one.  [SEP] > Like seriously this confuses me greatly, does no one on this subreddit get that WASM is a compile target and almost no one will write it directly?  Don't get too full of yourself, Tysonzero. Had you read the article I posted, you would've seen that I already know that WASM is a compile target, because I walk the reader from setting up an emscripten development environment (which builds most of the glue code for you) through compiling a sample C project into WASM, and then profiling the results to measure the impact. The opinion you're condescendingly trying to explain to me is actually the opinion I had before actually building a WASM project. And I'm saying this as someone who learned VB, C, C#, C++, and Java before learning PL\/SQL, Lua, Python, PHP, and JavaScript.  I'm excited to use WASM once it's more broadly supported and I get to stop caring about IE11, but I would never ever, ever, ever in a million years use WASM for anything but computationally heavy tasks. I foresee WASM being a good way to scale server-side applications by shifting the workload of heavy tasks from the server back to the client. The fact is, writing a color picker, or a dropdown, or any myriad other tasks using a freight train like WASM is overkill. For exactly the same reason that any scripting language exists. It's just not a necessary or efficient use of time. It takes longer to architect, it takes longer to create a development environment, it takes longer to build, and it takes longer to debug precisely because it's a compiled language.  JavaScript isn't popular for Node simply because of code reuse --- though that is part of it --- because Node isn't only used for web backends --- though that is one thing that Node does. JavaScript is also popular in Node for the same reasons that Python is popular: despite having some truly boneheaded idiosyncrasies, it's easy to build and debug \"things\" quickly than it is in compiled languages.  And no, I didn't say \"we'd all be using ASM\". What I said was \"we would all be writing assembly\". Those are two different statements. The fact that my compiler converts C++ code into ASM is immaterial to the fact that my project is written in C++.  The fact that you seem to think that WASM is a drop-in replacement really only tells me one thing: either you really suck at and\/or hate JavaScript, or you have never actually tried to use WASM. Methinks it's probably a combination of both.

You fail to see that corporations - absent government interference - must provide goods and\/or services which people desire and sell said goods\/services on the free market for a price. If they do not do this, than they go bankrupt and fail. Which means that in a truly free market, the only way companies can get rich is by providing for society. Which is a good thing and further illustrates that corporations in actuality have no power; they exist to serve the wants of the people that sustain them.  In order to produce goods and services for society, the owner of a company must initially forgo his own consumption and save his income such that he may use his savings to hire laborers and pay said laborers wages. He can now presumably produce more and better product. If this is true, his business will pass the market's test and people will buy more of his goods. He will expand. He is now able to employ more workers and produce more product. Society benefits.  In your little Marxian construct, the owner withholds money from his employees and gets richer and richer. However, in reality, if he does this his company suffers; he produces less, or his products are inferior (or both); people stop buying his product and buy somewhere else. He goes bankrupt or he starts spending more so that he can stay alive and stay profitable. Which is what that lovely little construct known as \"competition\" is all about.  If government arbitrarily interferes with this process, it retards the market's ability to function. Money is misallocated into areas where it should not have gone (like to paying workers more than the market rate) and society as a whole is worse off. Further, government sponsored fiat money allows consumption without production, which means corproations are able to make money from the government without actually producing anything that people want. THIS is how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.   You also fail to realize that laborers are free people with the ability to leave their job at any point. This is where their power lies. If a corporation is not catering to an employee's interests, than said employee can leave and work somewhere else. He could even start his own company. He is not forced to do anything. Business is ultimately at the mercy of the consumer, so long as government is not allowed to arbitrarily intervene. [SEP] >little Marxist construct.

It has nothing to do with scripture, either. Go back to Plato, aka the founder of Western philosophy: he posited a super-rational faculty called \"nous\" which transcended the rational and provided a divine blueprint for the universe. It's called by many names, but all theists adopt some version of the nous story. New Atheists, by contrast, tend to instead place faith in reason. Much as you did in this very post, New Atheists believe that rationality is the faculty that provides us with the closest approximation of \"the truth.\" Two faculties, one story.   2) It's clear you know very little about the scientific method. Science doesn't ever prove anything; it only disproves, and even then only temporarily. No one has \"disproven\" religious cosmology, because this is impossible. How many Christian nutters link the big bang to Genesis? Too many. As for your points about six days, etc. etc., these are all hand-waived as \"allegorical.\"   Besides all this, your arguments are scriptural. At heart, theism makes a single claim: that God exists.  [SEP] >Much as you did in this very post, New Atheists believe that rationality is the faculty that provides us with the closest approximation of \"the truth.\" Two faculties, one story.  When people start going to a church rather than a hospital to cure their illnesses, or praying their way to the moon rather than using centuries of scientific advancement to do it, I'll take this point seriously.   No one gives a single fuck about the magical allcause until they're either too lazy to explain a scientific principal or afraid of their own mortality.   This is because it explains literally nothing and is the realm of circlejerking philosophers who want to feel deep by claiming there is no objective truth, when maybe they could find that truth if they'd, y'know, study something useful.   >It's clear you know very little about the scientific method. Science doesn't ever prove anything; it only disproves, and even then only temporarily.  I like how you make that assumption. Nice and condescending, but here's why you're full of shit:  Science doesn't prove anything 100%, no. It proves things to a high degree of accuracy with a margin of error.  And yet, you never have some little agnostic wanker navel-contemplating about the unknowable nature of the toaster. It might not make toast. It might explode and burn your house down.  Years of experience and thousands of trials have taught you that the toaster makes toast, and yet, you can't say for 100% certain that this time won't be different until you actually press the button and do the trial.  And yet... why is there no Toaster Agnostic movement? Why is no one pointing out that we can't be sure, so is it really right to call it a toaster? Where is the 'It may or may not be a toaster' crowd?   Oh, right. They only use the 'well, science isn't 100% sure...' argument when science says something they don't want to hear.   For everything else, 99.99% certainty is fine. We'll take it for lifesaving surgery or airplane rides or making toast, but when it comes to sky fairies? By golly, we need mythical 100% evidence!   ---  tl;dr: I do not respect anyone who invokes the 'scientific uncertainty' argument for God, unless they also invoke it for airplanes, medicine, toasters, gravity... basically, every scientific principal or piece of technology.

Why do you think the default assumption is that sexual services are in a separate category?\"  That's ridiculous. a) the world certainly thinks it they are different (except you); b) the number of women who have suffered physical harm through prostitution vs. the number of people suffering physical harm from cutting the grass is vastly different; c) the number of women requiring therapy and medical attention for years afterward is vastly different than from those people who need therapy and mdical attention from cutting grass. The burden is on you - squarely on you - and your complete ridiculousness.  Now it is true - something being almost universally held doesn't make it true. But it does help shift he burden of proof. I've cited sources. You've cited baloney. I've made arguments. All you can do is say \"prove it more\". You've made no argument that cutting the grass is the same as subjecting yourself to the sexual demands of someone. Claiming it doesn't make it so. Your meager attempt to rationalize needed to be challenged.  I've pointed out repeatedly, with sources, prostitution is almost exclusively about men using their power over women. It's rampant with slavery, kidnapping, physical and sexual abuse almost always preying on women.  If you think the norm is that perfectly normal women just happen to want breast implants so badly that they will engage in wild sex acts in return is a fantasy. Has it ever happened? Maybe. But don't believe what you read.  Even in the only documented case of this - Olympian Suzy Favor Hamilton - ultimately needed serious help, and is regretful and remorseful for what she did.  You're welcome to keep considering me wrong. Just pointing out you've provided nothing.   [SEP] People may not get hurt cutting the grass, but there are plenty of other dangerous jobs where people do get hurt that we still treat like any other service. Loggers, slaughterhouse workers, sherpas, etc.   There are countries in the world (even counties in the United States) where prostitution is legal. So it is clearly not true that the whole world thinks sexual services are inherently exploitative.  The fact that there is widespread abuse in the sex trade is perhaps good reason for it to be illegal, but has no bearing on whether an individual instance is unethical. I don't contest any of your sources about women being treated unethically, I just think they are completely irrelevant to the question of whether a specific incident between two specific people is unethical.   >If you think the norm is that perfectly normal women just happen to want breast implants so badly that they will engage in wild sex acts in return is a fantasy.

First of all, this is comparing apples and oranges.  A hockey ring and goal is much much smaller in comparison to a footballfield\/goal. It takes less effort to score. Physically much more is allowed. Really, there is no way you can keep a straight face and compare penalties in either sports with eachother.   >If a football player who is attacking all alone is entering the penalty area to the far right, close to being out of bounds and is tackled, of course he is going to flop over and dive!  You're making it seem as if \"entering the penalty area\" is the easiest thing in the world. It's the task of defence, not only to prevent goals, but specially to keep attackers from entering the penaltybox. Once an attacker is inside the box, the risk of getting a goal against increases. Instead of \"blaming\" the concept of penalties, please consider the fact that a defender is already failing by allowing attackers to near his goalarea.  I'm not defending flopping or unfair play.

[SEP] >Really, there is no way you can keep a straight face and compare penalties in either sports with eachother.  Uhh, yes I can, because in both sports a penalty is supposed to be a replacement of an opportunity that was taken from a player in a rule-breaking way. The difference is that while hockey gives the player a chance to score again in a manner that has a very similar chance-to-goal ratio, a football penalty very often gives the player a much, much higher chance to score than he had before. This discrepancy is what makes diving advantageous for a player, since a penalty can be given even if the player had no chance to score. That is, if rules are followed, which they aren't always since referees usually don't have the guts to give penalties for such occasions. This tendency for referees not to give penalties for infractions that would have been a freekick had it taken place just a metre back, is evidence enough that something is wrong with penalties. Both the referees and the players know that a penalty carries more weight than almost every other decision in the game (save a red card), and as such the players will try to get one if they feel they aren't guaranteed to score from their present position.

Honestly, with one person pulling this much weight and working this hard to 'make it work', things could limp along like this for a very long time. It really is up to how much Op is willing to take, because her husband is unlikely to change. That would require an epiphany of some kind regarding his entire self, and he doesn't sound open to that kind of self reflection.   To Op directly: If he is unwilling to try couples therapy to address his inability to be in an equal and loving relationship, these issues will not be solved. The only real decision you have to make is how much you're willing to put up with in this regard, as your husband will not change with things as they are. You apologized three times because he was condescending and treated you disrespectfully. His reaction to your subsequent apologies (after the first one where you apologized for your actions, you had nothing left to apologize for but his behavior. Never offer an apology because you feel you deserve one in response; only offer one because you feel someone else deserves one from you, and you mean it) was to tell you to 'get the fuck out' of his apartment.   My only question is why would you stay, when he so clearly doesn't give a fuck about your marriage, and doesn't want you around? If he wanted you around, he wouldn't tell you to leave.

By the time you get a point in Phoenix, you should have finished Titanic's. this makes your wave clear better than Kayle or Ziggs.

Thank you for taking some time to do similar for me here. [SEP] I feel I ought to explain some things here as you took some parts of my argument considerably more personally than I had intended and I'm sorry about that.  Let me begin by saying that the reason I drew the lens back from beyond the parameters of what you were discussing was because I was trying to answer your basic question of why many people are very reflexive and defensive about any hint of victim blaming, and I had to go beyond what you were saying to illustrate that point.  >Well, that's damn offensive. I don't \"want women to behave\" in any particular way.. and I don't know which way it is you think I want. With the pure offense of this statement I can only imagine that you're telling me that I want women to be miserably crying away in a corner because of all the things they could have done.   Despite my propensity for being longwinded, on occasion I don't explain things as clearly as I should.  I know that this wasn't what you meant and that this was not where you were coming from (or where you felt you were coming from). I spun it in those terms to let you know how many other people- particularly women- might perceive it to give you some understanding of why it tees us off.  Secondarily, 'intent' is a lovely thing but it by itself does not change the meaning of things to certain people. That's just how it is, alas. It may help explain where you were coming from but the context of certain statements and ideas is also embedded in other peoples' experience, the broader society and culture, and other things besides your own ideas. Hence why something can appear offensive despite intent.  (Again, I was not offended by anything you said, but I am trying to illustrate why you may come across that way to others).  >So you haven't been arguing against me, but against a caricature of what my arguments could become? I guess I made the bad assumption that when someone responded to me in a conversation they were responding to me. Not dishonestly responding to something else, but pointing it at me.  So going back to where I began this comment, I was trying to make clear to you why, regardless of how nice and moderate one appears, you may appear to be condescending, to help you better understand why- in your view- there is little \"rationality\" in discussions on this topic.  I personally believe there is plenty, for reasons I've already explicated. But I'm trying to explain, and that involves going beyond what you said.  I do not appreciate the label of \"dishonest\" as I do my best to stay on topic and not spin anything, but I'm hoping that once my meaning becomes clear you'll see what I wrote a little differently.  >I think you know I never meant that absolute safety was achievable. But safety and self defense classes exist for a reason.  Indeed. I certainly don't discourage women or anyone else for that matter from taking self defence classes.

To my mind this is part of the problem. The concept that there are just bad individuals; that these bad individuals are not encouraged or empowered by social forces larger than themselves. I do treat people as individuals to the best of my ability, but I'm under no illusion that we do internalise certain social messages and worldviews to varying degrees that can justify some pretty ugly things or ideas.

I went through trauma growing up but made a point to take control of how I think of it and what it does to me.  How do you have a relationship with someone with BPD? Do you have to essentially parent them?  This all comes from being burned very hard last year by someone with BPD and likely NPD as well (or narcissism manifesting in ASPD). I likely have a degree of NPD though I tend to have some control of it or channel it in a pro-social way (it's also spurred me on to accomplish good things for myself). I had an experience of BPD myself as a result of the breakup with this person. It was horrible - I went from having full control of my emotions to losing it. Flight or fight mechanism was triggered in me, and I froze, hoping they'd stop trying to provoke a fight or give me a greenlight that things were okay. It didn't help that the previous year was spent with a roommate who likely also had it. How do you set limits with people who constantly push them? Is it possible to have a 2 person mature relationship? I gave them room in decision-making and they utterly ruined my life and the relationship. I couldn't have been any more fair. They meanwhile did pity plays, projected their immaturity on me, played mind games, and then expected friendship. After 10 years of knowing one another - they concealed their disorder well. Being in love with them made it horribly difficult. I refused to call them names, like they asked.  I have nothing against people with PDs, but I want to learn more and having been raised to be conscious of my behaviour, I expect others to likewise be able to control themselves. I just find it frustrating - the person I was with got sympathy and a job promotion out of the breakup, and my life fell apart.

You are better so you are handicapped to get closer to the opponent. Why are you handicapped? Because you basically don't have the option to add a 6th member to your team, as said team member would have no impact on your performance.  It's about having an even playing field. And if one team requires a coach to play on the same level as another team without a coach, then the coach-less team should win. And the way to ensure that is to remove the coach from the team.

I'm running out of ways to put this for you, but not every team benefits from having a coach. In-game leading isn't some hard coded role like you seem to think it is. It's a role that has naturally arisen through needing to call strategies. Some teams do better by having the in-game leader as one of the 5 players(GodSent, Echo Fox, SK) because some teams have in-game leaders that find it more effective to call strategies when they have the ability to move around in the game and gather information for themselves rather than from a spectators point of view, while other teams find it easier to have a coach out of game(NiP, NaVi, Liquid) because they believe they can do it more effectively when they can take a step back and see that spectators view.

You literally do not realize that everyone else says the same about you?  >You seem to suggest that such particularity is scandalous and reason enough for us to reject the notion of having a thing to be right about at all.  That wasn't really my point.  You are dead-set on one of the nigh-infinite conceptions of God, and you have no proof for it. You believe it entirely arbitrarily and yet you're confident that your blind guess is right, and that everyone elses is wrong.  That's the point of the geography reference. Either the fundamental nature of the universe changes every few miles, or, you're claiming that billions of people (hundreds of billions if you count the no longer living) are deluded, while your story is gospel truth. A story, which I'll add, has no supporting evidence. Only 'faith'.   That's my point: You're claiming (with no evidence) to be more knowledgeable than uncountable people, as if you personally were the only one to stumble onto the true account of God.  Except you didn't. You've never met God either; you're just as baseless as everyone else.  Do you legitimately not understand how baseless and unlikely any religions claims are? Are you too deeply indoctrinated to understand how someone could possibly doubt that the universe revolves around a random jew from the iron age?   >Also, do you turn the critique against yourself? If you weren't born here and now, odds are you wouldn't be an atheist (if that's what you are). Does that mean your atheism is wrong?  I simply reject all theistic claims without proof. I was 'raised' a Christian. I did not stick with it under the assumption that whichever cult my parents got suckered into was the one universal truth.   I would be an atheist no matter where I grew up, because I came to the conclusion on my own, without a holy book or someone preaching to me. I might have to hide it and pretend if I lived somewhere more hostile towards atheists, but I'd still not buy into nonsense.  It takes a special kind of arrogance to claim that hundreds of generations of humans were just silly, deluded, and worshiping myths.. and to then turn around and say that your own myth is when humanity finally got it right.   It's absolutely dishonest to trumpet a specific theory of God when no one has ever seen God or proved that there even is a god.  ---   Before it comes up, and believe me it always does, atheism does not imply a concrete claim that God isn't real. It means you don't believe. It means you don't look at an unexplained phenomena, make something up, and say 'case closed'. It means you wait for some actual evidence to emerge before making judgment.  And, since I expect it to come up too: No, the default position is not in between. The universe is not a 50:50 tossup between your personal religion and atheism. There are millions of other explanations; an atheist doesn't claim to support any given one, they just find it ridiculous to pick one before evidence shows up.  I don't mean to be condescending, it's just that the argument always comes up. People don't understand that atheism is a lack of a theological position, not a competing theological position, so they try and claim that it takes 'just as much' faith to claim God isn't real as to claim that he is.   My position towards God is the same as my position towards unicorns or extra-terrestrials: Don't believe in 'em, but if we find some I will revise my position.

No, I am not proud or happy anyone is harmed by any means. That is an amateurish secundum quid argument in that you assert if I own a gun then I am proud of the number of people harmed by them. There are actually quite a few fallacies in your reply, but I am pretty lit and don't feel like detailing them.  Lastly, you and the people like you need to stop blaming all gun owners for the acts of an extremely small amount of people (percentage-wise). I am a law-abiding, rational and productive human being. I have no intention of causing harm to another person. I put great effort into helping and uplifting my fellow man. When you and your ilk compare me to Adam Lanza based on the fact that he used a gun to mow down children and I have legally acquired guns, it is not only offensive but counter-productive to your cause.   If you want to make a difference, go verbally attack the people that are using the guns for illegal purposes. The majority of these people are hardened criminals living in impoverished areas, which is exactly why you don't bother with that campaign. These places are much more dangerous than your dorm rooms and parents' houses in gated communities. You and your kind are keyboard warriors and huge pussies, and don't have the gall to go after the real problem because they just might kill you. With a gun.

We recognize that we must deal wit the specific situation of small business and non-profit in an understandable way for Seattle voters, including many workers, who will be concerned about the impacts of $15.  15Now talk about this city council strategy in multiple media accounts.  If you don't see the Seattle city council passing this ordinance, with the $15 dollar figure, with no permanent tip credit, with no opt out for any sized business, with no franchise opt-out, with COLA included at all as a victory, that is your prerogative. I personally see it as a victory, after years of no policy pushed by a socialist party adopted as legislation. I look to activists in other locations celebrating $12, $10.10, $9.50, $8 and ask, what was different? Labor was active in all those fights and they didn't push for $15, even though that was the demand of the striking workers.  > not being honest about it is really damaging to their reputation, as it is insulting to the public  I guess we will have to see.

Sawant and Spear mentioned using this as a tool to pressure the city council at most oportunity- When 15Now wants to mobilize people to gather signatures and there is less enthusiasm then anticipated, how to you convey this central goal without further demobilizing volunteers?

Including, >Our goal is to collect 50,000 signatures  and the exact wording was  >but only if it has a credible chance of winning  Neither of those two statements help your case, as they both show that SA\/15 Now didn't follow its own stated plan.  It was not me that said this was not, or would not be a victory. It was council member Sawant and SA leaders who were denouncing this very bill, with all its exceptions, training wages, and 3 or 4 year phase in for big business. They were the ones calling it 15 in name only. That was the point I was making.  What you did in your latest comment is a perfect example of how you seem to think the public is dumb. You just can't seem to help but be condescending. I don't have amnesia and I know what is in the bill, which has yet to be finalized. Yes, SA said a lot of things about this campaign, and if I wanted to I'm sure I could go back and find a bunch of statements which support my argument. Oh, I found some in the material you linked, said by none other than CM Sawant  >Let\u2019s look at the proposal announced: the 4 year phase in for big business, 11 year delay, tip credit, health care deductions. I don\u2019t support phasing-in for big business. McDonalds and Starbucks have no justification for keeping their workers in poverty for a day longer. For workers in Seattle, 11 years is a very long time to wait for a decent wage. Every year of a phase in is another year of poverty for workers.  We don't have to wait and see if what SA is doing will be damaging to their reputation, it's already happening. You can find the evidence in the comments.  Your first few rhetorical questions are only relevant to you, as they completely miss the issue. For example, who cares how many signatures you collected. There is a threshold to make it onto the ballot which you are not going to achieve, and nor are you going to make it to 50k, your stated goal. That is what matters.   I think your last question is an important one, but it is somewhat convoluted as you don't describe precisely what your \"central goal\" is. If I understand it correctly, you are saying that you have to tell your volunteers to move forward with collecting signatures because that is what it needed to have a credible threat. And somehow it seems like you're making the case that you need to lie to those volunteers in order to keep them motivated.  The obvious solution here, which it seems like you have given no thought to, is to not collect any signatures at all. Because the bill will be voted on before those signatures are due, because it is obvious that you will not collect enough to get the amendment on the ballot, and because a poll was already taken which showed the majority of Seattle residents support a $15 minimum wage, I can't think of any good reason why you would collect any signatures at all.   So not only are you, SA\/15 Now, being disingenuous with your goals, you're lying to your own volunteers and the public for no good reason.

Here is a bonus: Being against higher taxes for the rich.   There is no evidence of higher taxes for the rich harming economic growth and, in fact, taxes for the rich could be 80%+ without negative effect.

I'm a little worried that the drag and drop system would limit what I can do. If i'm wrong in this anxiety lemme know, I'm gonna explore both programs (game maker and Construct). In your experience does construct limit what you can implement? Or is there drag and drop system expansive enough to implement whatever I can think of. [SEP] > In your experience does construct limit what you can implement?  I've only used it for prototyping. I'm all over the place with engines and frameworks, I'm a mess. You should ask people who concentrated on one engine or one framework for better answers. Seriously, you should!  I don't know how well it will work in a team, in terms of collaboration. But they have a desktop build now, which should help using git. I think you are able to attach JavaScript things as plugins - especially for 3rd party APIs, e.g. ad networks, Facebook, that kind of stuff. Those JavaScript plugins might be able to even more, maybe even take advantage of WebAssembly. If that's enticing, you should double-check if what I wrote is true. :-D  The other thing is: I don't know how it would be with bigger projects, lacking the experience myself. Will it slow down development compared to a programming language based engine? I don't know.  One more thing that comes to my mind: You can't write unit tests for Construct. Or can you.  -----  But let's stop here for a minute and realize two things:   1. Our human brain loves success moments, especially in small iterations. That's what you can get from an engine that helps you prototype fast (in my opinion). That's part of why Adobe Flash \/ now Adobe Animate as a tool was fun to use imho. On the other side of the spectrum, there's probably C code from scratch barely with any libraries to help you make your game. It will take a long time before you produce anything that looks and feels even remotely like a game. The reward-system parts of your brain will have a harder time. Would that slow you down compared to the 'instant' successes you see and you feel with an engine like Construct? You decide!  2. You don't choose only one engine for your life! Once you hit the limits of, say, Construct, you can switch to something else: MonoGame, Unity, Unreal or Amazon's Lumberyard, anything. How long will it take you to really hit the limits of Construct? 6 months? 18 months? I don't know. Play around with the free trial and make a few very small games with it, that should only take a few afternoons. And let your gut feelings decide imho.  Yes, Construct is not for free. But it's not exactly the price of a Tesla Model X, either.   ------  > Or is there drag and drop system expansive enough to implement whatever I can think of.  Try to find commercial games made with Construct. It should give you an idea of what is possible. It's line-up probably is different from the plethora of hit games you see with Haxe, Heaps (Dead Cells, Northgard), HaxeFlixel, OpenFL (Papers, Please), Monogame and FNA (Stardew Valley, Axiom Verge).  But in the end you have to trust yourself and watch your own inner visions: What are you really capable of, when will you hit your creative, artistic and technical limits? Do you really strive for technical superiority so you need Unity or Unreal engine? Or will a 'smaller engine' like Construct enable you do everything you need - and make you feel good while doing so?  -----------  > Double reply but would it make more sense to go with gamemaker instead of construct for flexibility?  Yesterday I read that GameMaker will support the Nintendo Switch in a few months. But then again, it's supposed to be hard to get there because Nintendo is an opinionated gatekeeper for their Switch console, so what are your chances to hop on the Switch train before the world jumps over to the successor of the Switch console in a few years?  I personally don't trust Gamemaker really. Their staff seems to be condescending and swamped in an ocean of bugs. Their GML language has so many legacy commands and a really awkward syntax and code style. Have a look at their forums and you'll see people regard basic programming things like 'arrays' like high technology needed to send people to Mars. And they even invented a lot of crap around the world surrounding arrays, like ds_list and all that awkward stuff - seemingly because they don't trust their own 'normal' arrays?

There's a difference in assessing this for a group and for an individual. There's a difference in doing this with a professional writer and a forum post. There's a difference in doing this for a specific topic or a very general one. There's especially a difference in doing this when you're trying draw conclusions about life's difficulty by using concepts of intersectionality. It's literally about the intersection of different types of oppression and how you can't fully assess them in isolation because they all intermingle and are all relevant to each other. Whether applying the concept of privilege with regards to 3 different spheres but ignoring one that dwarfs them all in importance is naive or intentional I can't say, but it's one or the other. Even by the standards of intersectionality, you cannot accurately assess something as absolute as \"life's difficulty setting\" without consideration to their economic privilege or lack thereof. Asserting a conclusion about the former without consideration for the latter is complete bullshit.  But if you can find a piece of professional writing I've made on the topic of intersectionality and want to make inferences on my position by what I've omitted, by all means feel free. Hell I'll rescind the \"professional writing\" stipulation.   I am not saying the desire or impetus to push for social equality is bad or evil because of what this one person said. I am saying that how this one person titled his article about privilege says a lot about his views and limited understanding about the topic. I am not extrapolating it to be a majority consensus or misunderstanding of the entire group. This person is part of said group. Therefore there exists a minority of members of this group with said characteristics. Unless the group were to decry said statements. The opposite actually happened, but even then I do not take that as indicative of the entire group or a majority of it.  >If you view people talking about white privilege through a lens where you assume they're attacking white people ... then yes, suddenly it becomes all encompassing and so many people are attacking whites. Because a lot of people are talking about white privilege, and rightly so. The problem is that talking about white privilege isn't necessarily (and in almost all cases definitively isn't) an attack on white people.  No, I don't think talking about privilege automatically equals bigotry. But it happens often enough that I don't need to think that to see what the OP is talking about either. I see concepts of privilege often used to divide people into in groups and out groups, and used to attack said out groups. I see the topic discussed with open hostility (ever heard the term shitlord, or manbaby?) and the word privilege thrown around like an accusation. I see it used to shut down conversation and opinions (again, to my original reply to yours, see mansplaining, whitesplaining). I see the people oblivious to their own privilege berating less privileged to \"check their privilege\" because they can bastardize intersectionality enough to convince themselves that they are truly the oppressed class. I see it used to dismiss the opinions of marginalized groups because of \"internalized racism\/sexism\".  You can say you don't see these things happen or encounter them. That seems suspicious to me, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I'm not going to hit you with a list of links if you don't want, but I'd be happy to provide some that leave little room for interpretation.  >Which when you're depressed is not always a good thing.

You're telling me there was no library in the school or the town? Bullshit.  Hi, OP here. You're making a huge assumption here, and it's that we could afford books. My house did have a lot of them, but those were bought years before, in a prosper time when my father was working as an engineer in an uncle's factory. Thing is, my father was not an engineer; he was a musician who knew some things about engineering, so when he got laid off after the company bankrupted, we moved to a rural town really far from there to live under a church musician's salary. So now we were barely able to afford food, and I mean barely (we couldn't even afford shelter; part of my father's contract was that he was to live in the church's designated house for travelling pastors because they currently had a local one), so when I ran out of books, I ran out of books. I didn't know if there was a local library or where that would be, because, as I found out later, absolutely nobody ever approached that place, and most people didn't even know there was one (I was always the only one there). So, seeing how I wasn't allowed to read regular books and my teacher was very religious, I thought maybe that would be OK because I knew fuck about the constitution.  I was not a prick when that happened; I was ten and a really shy kid who didn't socialise much because I was new in town and scared of the people around me, since they were too different to anyone I knew before. I became a prick over time, when it became clear that no matter how hard I tried, I would always be held back by people who felt my effort wasn't fair. So I stopped making an effort, and started doing the very minimum I needed to get decent results. And it's worked so far; people don't expect much from me and think I try my hardest when actually I half-ass everything the day before. It brought me a crisis when I realised I can't do the same for my thesis, but besides that, it's been a sweet nine years.

SR deals with bodies in motion within the spacetime and GR deals with spacetime as created by a static body (non-moving).

So it is this 'force of gravity' that explains why things in motion and static mass influence the length of spacetime? (or the length of time?) and if so how?  This brings me back to LCDM, and allows me to questions then why you require the ability to 'dial in' extra gravity so that the  'opposing force' to gravity does not cause galaxies to 'fly apart', and of course you cant explain how this other mysterious force (centrifugal force) acts like an anti-gravity force. (straight from Newton).   And why you simulate cosmic motion using Newtonian dynamics.   Why can't you measure or observe any curvature? Treating it as a curvature how do you explain the differences in the duration of time at different locations. Is it infinite geodesics or something.

You can perseverate with something you don't like in order to avoid something you don't like even more. (E.x. cleaning to avoid homework) >  \"Doesn't only\" works both ways. The issue is finding ways to interrupt it when necessary.  Perseveration, in ADHD, is usually triggered by things that stimulate a person past a specific threshold.   Using anxiety to trigger perseveration in order to procrastinate... That's a different issue. I fail to see its relevance.    >The other issue is that equating \"avid\" (very eager\/wanting to do something very much) reader with perseveration makes it sound like reading is a choice. It isn't, because perseveration isn't a choice. Perseveration is literally doing something in excess, beyond what you actually want to do. That's not eagerness, it's compulsion and I don't think we should romanticize it. >   You talk like you think you're a slave. \"Oh noes! There isn't a choice!\"  That sentiment contains less truth than you believe.  You have a choice about how you respond to it, and what you do with it.   Knowing ADHD as I do now, diagnosed as an adult, all this information could have changed my life had I known it earlier, even without access to meds.  In terms of Low Arousal Theory perseveration is triggered by things that stimulate us.   Look at all the thing ADHD people do to self stim. From fidgeters to adrenaline junkies.  They're all associated with increasing dopamine levels, which means that they aren't generally associated with discomfort.  Time management is a skill. Knowing one's own ADHD is also a skill. Time management with ADHD is a very special skill (which I don't claim to have mastered, that would be a lie).   Use alarms, e.g. the Pomodoro technique, or any other method available to interrupt perseveration.  e.g. Do your reading where you know you will be interrupted if you can't afford to lose too much time to it..   Perseveration is. To use a saying I hate, \"It is what it is.\"  You can view it negatively and dwell on how much you hate it... or you can find advantages and learn to work with and around it.    >Also, what do you mean we should be able to do \"well\" at something when we learn to like\/enjoy it? It isn't necessarily a question of whether someone enjoys reading. I enjoy reading but I literally can't do it for an extended period of time unless I'm medicated\/perseverating. Would that make me bad at reading?   Medication raises your state closer to that arousal threshold.   That's why you can (mildly?) perseverate and\/or read easier on it.   In this framework, maybe you don't love reading. Maybe you're like me with maths and have issues with it (not maths phobic, but some kind of hangup).  Maybe you just don't enjoy it enough. (Enjoyment is also arousal, btw.)  Have you never found anything you enjoyed reading enough to get lost in it?   You do know that neurotypicals get lost in reading, film, and music too, right? Not usually as powerfully, but they do (and \"neurotypical\" isn't as well defined as people like to think it is).   On meds, I have to take extra care. Sometimes it's \"improved focus\" and sometimes it's mild\/low grade perseveration. And it can be a fine line between.  I have alarms on my phone to warn me about break time, because I can become time blind with certain tasks.   We also have to learn to keep the larger task in focus (and not get lost wikipedia surfing, for example). This is both easier and harder on meds.    You seem to have a bias against ADHD symptoms and are determined to see them as negatives.  You will never be able to separate yourself from ADHD; it had a hand in forming you. Without ADHD, you wouldn't recognise yourself.  As contradictory as it may sound, you need to learn to accept yourself while bettering yourself.   Civilisation has not existed very long, and modern society since the industrial revolution is is nothing compared to how long our species has been evolving.  To automatically assume that the neuro-atypical is defective or \"ill\" is not logical. If you look at the epidemiology statistics for ADHD, we are too many to be a recent accident, it is genetic.  We were not culled by evolution. That means we must have had advantages.   Admittedly, they don't seem well suited to modern society, but you can only work with what you've got.  Are you going to work with it, or are you going to resent it?   Bitterness and anger as motivators can only carry you so far. And they rarely help one be a better person. [SEP] Perseveration in ADHD occurs due to executive functioning impairment. Task switching & properly allocating attention fall within that realm. Perseveration can also be used as a coping mechanism, to avoid stressful or daunting situations.   >You talk like you think you're a slave. \"Oh noes! There isn't a choice!\"  >That sentiment contains less truth than you believe.  >You have a choice about how you respond to it, and what you do with it.    Your use of the word \"slave\" rubs me the wrong way because it's condescending. You're addressing me as if you somehow know more about my own ADHD management than I do. I don't speak as if I think I'm a slave, I speak as if I'm someone who has dealt with crippling perseverating behaviors. I speak as if I am someone who experiences not being able to do the things I know I should do because I am compulsively engaging in something else.  Perseveration is something an individual cannot control. If they could, it wouldn't be perseveration. Something external must break the circuit yet you say I speak as if I have no choice in the matter.

IQ tests are a flawed measure of intelligence. These flaws range from practice effects, to cultural bias, to problems with statistical and theoretical modeling. An IQ difference of \"15 points\", or 1 standard deviation on one of the scales used to describe IQ, was used in the horribly racist book \"The Bell Curve\" to give fake validity to the claim that black people are less intelligent than white people.    (Spoiler warning: They are not.)   I have a feeling that your claim of a 15 point difference for a specific subgroup of Jews has similar problems to those of the book.   Also: \"Most\" IQ test? Which ones? If it really is \"most\", many of them will use sometimes wildly differing methods of standardization, so \"15\" points is absolutely meaningless. For example, some tests use a mean of 50, and a standard deviation of 10, others use 100 and 15, or 100 and 10 - z standardization uses 0 and 1, respectively. I repeat: \"15 points\" is meaningless, even before going into the flaws of IQ models in general.  2. Where do most Nobel Prize winners come from?

I consider myself a pretty open minded individual and I can see both sides of the argument. But I do feel you're dealing with some misinformation, and maybe some bias in your own statement. Maybe I'm wrong, and if so, I would like to be corrected. I hope we can have a friendly, and productive conversation - and perhaps we can both learn from it.   Trump proposed banning further Muslim immigration, not banning Islam, as you seem to believe. Additionally, the ban it's about securing boarders, not about hate towards a group or race of people. He has obviously taken steps towards limiting other types of immigration as well, and the reasons for this are many. However, I feel that there is a stereotype towards Islam that has only been reinforced by recent attacks in Europe, and despite those responsible being part of a small minority, people are getting scared. It's natural for people to want to feel safe, and it's hard to feel secure in an airport when the last thing you heard on the news was a report of scores of people murdered in an airport.   I have friends who were going to visit Brussels this month, but have canceled their plans. It is the same concept as your Disneyland example, but on a worldwide scale, and not hypothetical.   Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Islam is the inherent problem, there have been many instances throughout history where the teachings of a religion has been misinterpreted and led to bloodshed (Christianity, for example). But there is something off regarding the silence from the Islamic community, I feel that it would do a great deal of good if Americans saw a rising up of the peaceful majority of Islamic believers. A public outcry against the acts of violence, especially in countries where there are large Islamic communities would make a world of difference on the global outlook towards Islam as a religion. But until that happens, until there is more positive than negative coverage of Islam, this trend of stereotyping will continue to slip forward, and probably result in some pretty bad situations.   America will always be a place of free religion, as long as that religion doesn't inhibit the freedoms of others. For example, the Westboro Baptist Church is allowed to exist even though they represent a truly corrosive \"religion\" which blatantly harbor hate and use it for their own devices. In no way will the Islamic religion, at it's core, ever get close to this level of indecency. I don't see Islam or Muslims being banned from America. I don't feel that, in my town, there is excessive stereotyping against Muslims or Islam.   A few notes on your \"common factors\":   Not all terrorists are Muslim. [ http   Not all terrorists are men. Being in the military, I've closely studied the tactics of terrorists and the use of woman is common, especially in war zones. [ http    Many terrorists have not killed people. If you think that every misguided Islamic follower immediately meanders off to murder someone or a group of people you would be wrong. Terrorists are not on a lower level of intelligence, they aren't mindless killing zombies. Some comb the internet, searching for converts tot their cause. Some spread verbal terrorism (words that incite hate and violence). And some sit at home and silently cheer their comrades onward. Terrorism is a movement, \"terrorist\" is not a status that one gains on blowing themselves up in public.  [SEP] Some thoughts:  I think \/u\/TLTheDougler has called out most of the points that I wanted to address but as a Muslim I think that there are some other points that I should step in and comment on as well.  >But there is something off regarding the silence from the Islamic community, I feel that it would do a great deal of good if Americans saw a rising up of the peaceful majority of Islamic believers. A public outcry against the acts of violence, especially in countries where there are large Islamic communities would make a world of difference on the global outlook towards Islam as a religion.   This is something I hear a fair bit as a Muslim and our community has done A LOT to counter the idea that Muslims aren't raising their voice against extremism. I can understand why it may seem that Muslims are kinda quiet about it but in every sense of the phrase: Muslims are very much standing up against extremism.  Off the top of my head I can remember countless examples of the Islamic community rejecting and speaking out against terrorism. To site a few significant examples of this:  Letter to Badgdadi. An open letter to the ISIS leader from HUNDREDS, literally HUNDREDS of reputable Islamic scholars, ranging from a multitude of background and academic work. Signed not only by Islamic scholars but important Muslims spokespersons, Imams, Diplomats and non-Muslim religious leaders and academics alike. I would HIGHLY recommend you read this letter yourself(To get an understanding of how we view the acts of ISIS from an academic point of view) and take a look at the plethora of signatories it has received from around the world.   Also this amazing post that was made after the Paris attacks which highlights some of the many voices that were raised in the aftermath of the attack. A prime example of the Muslim community coming together and raising their voice against tyrants and terrorists. Please also go through all the condemnations in this one.  If there is still any doubt then here is another collection of Islamic statements against terrorism. It would take you an hour to go through them all. The even greater thing is that right after that he lists a list of other sources that have also made lists of Islamic statements made against terrorism, so there's even more to read. You could go on and on and on.  Or how about this social campaign made to promote the Prophet's(PBUH) virtues to counter negative stereotypes about Islam and Muslims.  The point is, there has been a TON of voices raised by Muslims in response to terrorism. Remember, Muslims are the biggest casualty group in these terror attacks around the world. Our pain runs deep and our hatred for these ideals is strong. We were never afraid of raising our voices, it's just that we hardly ever get the stage to do so. It's really a shame that despite all these efforts some think that the Muslim community chooses to remain quiet about this glaring issue. I hope I was able to help erase some misconceptions.

As you clearly failed to read it, here's the relevant part, translated for your convenience:  > A survey based on interviews of 42,000 women from all EU countries, published in March 2016 by the EU's rights agency (FRA) 14 states that Sweden tops the new EU Statistics on physical and sexual violence against women, sexual harassment and stalking. The conclusion is that the result is a consequence of the Nordic alcohol culture, but also of non-traditional gender roles.  And in the simplest words possible, police attribute a steep rise in sexual and physical violence against women - which just so happened to occur when muslim migrants arrived - to Swedish culture. IE. Swedish culture is causing these incidents and must is the problem, not the migrants committing the assaults. Blatant erosion and attack on Swedish culture in the name of supporting Islamic culture.  >Pretty tragic murder. Where's the evidence it - or the lack of a memorial - is related to 'culture' in any way?  The vigil that would've been held would've been the culture. Unfortunately the family and friends of the victim were told they weren't allowed to practice their culture and hold a vigil because it might upset Muslim migrants. The culture link is that Swedes were told they could not practice their culture in holding a vigil for their murdered loved one because, their culture was disregarded in favour of the culture of the migrants.  >From BreitBart to British shock tabloids, the parade of quality journalism keeps rolling on in. Actual journalistic outlets regularly debunk the myth of no-go zones but hey, that doesn't move copy.  Once again, attacking the source instead of the content - could that be because you have no grounds to debunk the content so seek to discredit it instead? Sure seems like it.  Never mind the fact that no-go zones are also reported in:   http    http    http    http   But yes clearly the fact that a tabloid reported it means they don't exist.   But let's talk about how Bloomberg \"debunked\" these no-go zones shall we? Firstly, they're clearly time travelers - the article published in January of 2015 obviously conclusively states that no-go zones do not exist in Europe in May of 2016. Secondly, their idea of 'debunking' is for a politician to retract his comments after a public opinion backlash, and one Muslim business owner in Paris laughing at the premise. This is clearly much stronger evidence than Swedish police stating they will not enter certain neighborhoods.   >Another tabloid, brilliant.

It's not an example of Muslims controlling the UK justice system, it's an example of Muslims subverting the UK justice system to enforce their own laws. The point of the example is that if this group were large enough to control the electorate, Sharia law would become the law of the UK, as evidenced by their priority of following Sharia first and UK laws second. How is ignoring existing law to practice Islamic law not Islamification?  >A reputable source, at last!

Maybe you should reconsider renaming this category to 'the views of a couple dozen people in Europe' instead of 'Laws\/Justice System'.  More deliberate mis-representation of the point of the links. It's not about the Muslims being ingrained into the justice system, it's about the Muslims placing Sharia law above the law of the country they live in.

Which does address the potential impropriety, but nothing else, and when you get a reaction like that from people, you should take a moment to ask them if they would be open to the expansion if it was non-partial. And you didn't. When I questioned you, you said that the people who didn't like R5\/AGG stuff would have left by now anyway, so I know that you know that this was a questionable change in terms of user reception.  It's fine if you just said, \"Fuck it, we just have to do this in order for things to work better and batter down the hatches!\" but you've tried to come at me with this attitude of you caring about user feedback and incorporating it into so much of what you do and how I never did--which is odd, considering that I have an actual track record of it and it hasn't been your responsibility for more than a week--and that's what causes me to cry foul, because it isn't true. And it's fine that it's not, but don't SAY that it is.  As far as your rules, my problems have to deal with the logistical nightmare, much like r4. Condescending things down, letting some rules go while loosening others, it's a little more efficient in some ways, but in other ways it leaves holes, and when it comes to a subreddit with this much user drama and stickies, you could have waited until everything was ready until you patched this in and took stuff out that probably wasn't ready to be.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"I mean, if you think any of the comments I made break the rules aside from the one where I called him a \"specimen\" (understandable enough) then I'm not sure how you haven't been just as bad in that regard.

It is a documented fallacy and illustrates poor reasoning skills.

Thats the body of evidence that I rely on, care to share what you may have that contradicts this?  >I didn't grasp at straws by questioning your (still unsupported by any evidence whatsoever) claim that the government would not kill or allow a lot of its own citizens to die to further its goals, and I used >historical evidence to contradict it.

So people are essentially making claims that they might have sort of allowed it to happen, or something, and that is thinking critically. Got it.  >Patriot Act Things  Cool. If they have all this power, why do 9\/11.

This kind of widens the small number of people you are referring to in the DoD quote right? Im not going to deny that people made some serious money off the \"War on Terror\" but how does this relate back to it being more plausible that it is some kind of false flag operation rather than plain old incompetence of a alphabet soup of intelligence agencies that colossaly dropped the ball dealing with a part of the world that we understood so poorly before 9\/11?  >First of all what does being a backwater nation have anything to do with the invasions or covert influencing of governments? Because if you are going to invade a nation for gain, why pick one that exports basically Heroin? Why invade a country that was firmly in the orbit of our regional ally Pakistan?

Also UN operation 3. Vietnam - Misguided application of domino theory. Here is an actual example of your false flag btw. One we know all about btw, unlike this ultra secret 9\/11 one 4. Korea - We invaded to stop the hostile communist takeover of the Western partition, during a particularly dark era of the Cold War. 5. Guatemala - Because United Fruit company was butthurt about not making a killing anymore. Again, we know all about it.  So why Afghanistan? Why pin it on a nation that gains us literally nothing? Its landlocked so we have to route all of our logistics via Pakistan or Russia, two nations that we are not always on the best of terms with. Again, why not make it Iraqis? seems like a two birds with one stone type of deal, if we have the capability to complete a false flag operation with not a soul finding out about it would be pretty simple to extend it to make the hijackers Republican Guard or something. Hell, why not mount another False Flag to plant those WMDs we claimed were there?  >Furthermore Afghanistan is not just some backwater nation, it is a mineral rich region.

Cody, 264 U.S. 339, 368 (1924). In other words, \"[t]he Lanham Act seeks to prevent consumer confusion that enables a seller to pass off his goods as the goods of another.... [T]rademark infringement protects only against mistaken purchasing decisions and not against confusion generally.\" Lang v. Ret. Living Publ'g Co., 949 F.2d 576, 582-83 (2d Cir. 1991).  In WWP, this clearly occurred--one veteran's aid website used a nearly identical name as the other to co-opt goodwill, boosting its own donations at the expense of Wounded Warrior Project's. Here, there's no chance that a website called comcastroturf.com, and whose entire purpose of the website is not to solicit donations, but to name-check against the FCC database, would be confused with a company that provides telecom services.  Nowhere on the comcastroturf.com website does the word \"donate,\" \"contribute\" or anything similar even appear--you have to click through to fightforthefuture.com logo, de-emphasized at the very bottom of the page, and then click through 2 more times to start the donation process. That is not trademark infringement. By the time you get to the Fight for the Future website and click through again, there is no possibility of confusion that the user would be receiving Comcast services.  Even if you're talking about a trademark dilution claim, this website would still be outside of the scope. In order to be considered \"commercial speech,\" and thus outside of the noncommercial defense to trademark dilution, the speech must \"do no more than propose a commercial transaction.\" Here, none of the speech on the website even proposes a commercial transaction. The website has you look to see if your name has been falsely used as a commenter on an FCC APA notice and comment procedure. At minimum, that \"does more than propose a commercial transaction.\"  You sound like you're still in law school. Creative issue spotting, but you should always make sure that you're based in the fundamental tenets of the law before you advance a creative argument. [SEP] >I didn't think that I'd have to explain the most basic underpinnings of trademark law, but judging by your reliance on the completely inapposite WWP, I guess I do.  So that'd be a \"no\" on actually discussing this with a modicum of respect.  I do enjoy that in your deigning to explain, you miss that there have been some pretty substantial changes in federal trademark law since 1924.  You do know that \"statutes\" can change more readily than the constitution, right? And that when statutes change the \"statutory interpretation\" of the courts move with them? No?  Great, keep arguing that non-profits aren't subject to trademark claims.  >In WWP, this clearly occurred--one veteran's aid website used a nearly identical name as the other to co-opt goodwill, boosting its own donations at the expense of Wounded Warrior Project's  Except your argument was that trademark law does not apply to a non-profit at all. Pick the argument you'd like to actually claim is \"slam dunk\" legal fact and stick with it.  Either Wounded Warrior was wrong because trademark cannot apply to non-profits. Or it can apply to non-profits and you should probably apologize for being such a condescending dick while being wrong about that.  Given those options, I'm going to tend to side with the Second Circuit over... whatever credentials you're purporting to have.  >[t]he Lanham Act seeks to prevent consumer confusion that enables a seller to pass off his goods as the goods of another.... [T]rademark infringement protects only against mistaken purchasing decisions and not against confusion generally  And if you'd been smart enough to limit your argument exclusively to trademark infringement, boy would my face be red.  Fortunately for my face, if unfortunately for the appearance of your competence, here's what you've actually claimed:  > there is no trademark protection  -  >This isn't a trademark issue. If a court got a trademark case on this issue, it would be a slam dunk case  Note not \"trademark infringement\", you wrote \"a trademark issue.\" So I was curious why you would cite something dealing exclusively with an infringement claim as though it definitively proves no trademark case exists.  Until I realized that since you're mostly just googling this stuff, you might not be aware that in addition to trademark infringement under the Lanham act, trademark also covers \"dilution\" both by \"blurring\" and through \"tarnishment\" under the FTDA passed in 1995 and TDRA in 2006. To say nothing of state dilution\/tarnishment laws  Since I don't want to burden you with what is the bare minimum of competent legal research, I'll reproduce the necessary section from the TDRA:  >shall be entitled to an injunction against an- other person who, at any time after the owner\u2019s mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury  Do you need a refresher on whether a prior court decision overrides a statute?  But let's dig a bit deeper as long as you're being both condescending and wrong. Fight for the Future (owner of the site and the organization identifying itself as a fund on the site) is located in Massachusetts. What does Massachusetts law have to say about it?  >Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark registered under this chapter, or a mark valid at common law, or a trade name valid at common law, shall be a ground for injunctive relief notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services  Note that it doesn't require commercial use (so you lose there) and doesn't require actual confusion (sorry, buddy).  Maybe do a bit more research on what exists in trademark beyond \"OMG infringement\" before spouting off next time.  >Nowhere on the comcastroturf.com website does the word \"donate,\" \"contribute\" or anything similar even appear  Except for \"fund.\" As in \"a thing which receives donations and uses them for their stated purposes.\" But I'm sure you're right that the only time something can be considered an advertisement is if it contains the words \"click here and buy something\" rather than the name of the organization sponsoring the thing. Feel free to provide your citation for that.  If it's anything like your trademark work I expect you'll ignore two thirds of the entire topic.  >In order to be considered \"commercial speech,\" and thus outside of the noncommercial defense to trademark dilution, the speech must \"do no more than propose a commercial transaction  Which works as long as you treat an advertisement for the creator's own organization directly soliciting money on the page directly linked to as being substantially different from an advertisement for a for-profit organization also soliciting. Here's what you see on the page immediately linked to:  >Our organization works hard to organize against threats to our basic rights, please help keep up going and visit our donate page.  Which brings me back to:  >and then click through 2 more times to start the donation process  You're adding a new (and disingenuous) standard to Kremer which would include not just whether it immediately advertises but also how many clicks from the solicitation to the end purchase. That's not the standard from Kremer  >Kremer's website contains no commercial links, but rather contains links to a discussion group, which in turn contains advertising  Once you hit the advertising the chain stops. You'd like to add \"once you've seen the solicitation and decided to do it how many steps is it.\"  See e.g Bihari v. Gross, 119 F. Supp. 2d 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), where the court did not include how many steps from the initial advertisement to the point of sale as part of analyzing commercial speech.  But feel free to invent new standards, it's endearing.  >Here, none of the speech on the website even proposes a commercial transaction  Right, it merely advertises for a non-profit (transactions with which can be considered commercial and under the auspices of trademark) which does.  But I'm sure you're right and an ad for Walmart would be non commercial as long as the link doesn't say \"give money to Walmart\" and you only see that if you click the link.  >You sound like you're still in law school.

But since I'm not the one who forgot \"state law\" is a thing and that trademark includes more than likelihood of confusion, I'd be less smarmy.  Though, it is charming that you would mention \"creative issue spotting\" while trying to pull solely from your ass a new doctrine of \"an ad is only commercial speech if the ad itself directly solicits a transaction.\"  Feel free to take me up on that bet, and\/or try to have a discussion more like someone with enough legal knowledge to disagree respectfully with other people rather than feel the need to \"correct\" them about \"slam dunk\" issues.

How does her personality change that fast?  She berated Sorey for touching her for too long. Did you not notice what words she used? She constantly uses \"when\" which is a word associated with time. This doesn't conflict with her touching his cheek at all. She wasn't even touching him for a long time. Oh, and even if she does, it still isn't a contradiction. There are people who aren't comfortable with others initiating physical contact with them, but are comfortable with themselves initiating physical contact with others.

Holy shit.  >which makes sense from a video game perspective since you are supposed to be Sorey (at least I assume you are)  Oh jeez, I wonder why ToZ players find the game to pale in comparison with other Tale games.

Should he just silently shoot Eizen while flashbacking the hell back to their times. Also, not everything needs to be shown. Some people just take \"show, not tell\" to the extreme and complain about every little exposition. You actually need to balance it out to make the narrative compelling.  >I understand there are time limitations, but with two random episodes in between that only advertised some other game, and with this show supposedly being split-cour (not sure if this is true)  This I agree with. There are time limitations, and that could hinder the story pacing. As of now, I'm not sure how to feel about the Berseria episodes at all. I definitely hope that it becomes relevant in the next cour (which is definitely happening because they haven't even introduced all the characters yet by EP8) so that the payoff will be great.  >I think they could've built these characters up better so that I could actually feel their emotions.  This is like the first episode that you get to know Zaveid and Edna. I don't know how much \"better\" you want. Also, not being able to empathize with the characters doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad writing. It could be or not be bad writing. In this case, it's not (because we haven't even got to know them long enough to judge that aspect just yet) and it's just that you don't like these character archetypes. You don't identify with them. That's just a clash of personality. Stop blaming the anime when there is nothing concrete to prove your point.  >All the characters are generic as hell, and really, the only reason I've watched up to this point is because it looks visually appealing and the OP\/ED are good.  They are generic, but that doesn't make them bad characters. It still doesn't prove your point. You should seriously just say \"I personally don't identify with these characters, and it's a bit difficult for me to keep on watching\" instead of throwing around accusations and saying how the anime alienates \"anime-only\" viewers. I feel pity for you that you hate an anime so much that you think it is deliberately alienating and antagonizing you, AND all the \"anime-only viewers\" that you DON'T represent.  I'm one of the \"anime-only viewer\" who knows about the game, but never bothered to play it. I've known the Tales franchise for years, but I wasn't interested in watching Zestiria (because of a recent lack of interest in the series).

I guess the only reason why I, an \"anime-only viewer\", would enjoy watching this is because I self-insert myself into Sorey and feel good about myself? [Insert Pepe FeelsBadMan.png]  Also, the anime is definitely flawed. It's not perfect by any means. However, everything that you have listed has to do with your personality more than it has to do with the anime. I'll list some things that are actual flaws for you:  - Not a huge amount of \"animating\". Due to the focus on the visuals, the characters themselves are barely animated. More than often, you would see characters being static images when not engaging in a fight. It's extremely apparent in CGI scenes where some characters would just stand and do nothing. It's not because the characters are meant to do nothing, but simply because Ufotable don't bother animating background characters.   - Uninteresting directing. This is purely subjective. However, I would personally say it is a flaw when compared to the likes of JoJo Part 4. It also has to do with the fact that there isn't much movement (less animating). Movement, sound (effects, voice acting, music), visuals (background, transitions, visual tricks), and focus is important in creating different kinds of moods. Zestiria doesn't have much visual tricks compared to JoJo Part 4 (which would do something like changing the colors of the scene, or overlaying scenes together like some manga panels). This is largely due to the fact that Zestiria's backgrounds are extremely detailed, making it hard to do visual tricks with it. Simply changing the color saturation would look bad, but recoloring entire backgrounds would also take a long time. That, and the director probably don't have much experience with doing those kind of things. So it's mostly just characters being animated with a static background in the back (which is often animated with CGI to make it look less static, but it creates lag because CGI has a high frame rate. That's why when CGI is used, the anime characters are lagging when moving (they are being animated with less frames than CGI).  That's probably it I guess. There would probably be more things to say, but I don't want to delve into it too much.  tl;dr - You are taking things too personally, and thinking that the anime is specifically alienating you + a certain group of people. However, the majority of your complaints have to do with you simply not being able to empathize with those characters. It would be best if you could make reasonable points next time. Then again a rant is defined as \"to complain in a way that is unreasonable\" so I guess you aren't wrong...technically.   [SEP] > Uh, I guess that's what introductions are supposed to be for?  It's funny how you broke my one sentence into two parts to make it seem like I said something contradictory. I wonder why you responded to \"yet Sorey acts like he's known these guys for years\" separately? Maybe so you could make it seem like you found some glaring contradiction in my post?   > The only reason why you would feel that way is because he calls them by their names.  Did you not read the rest of my post? How are you assuming that that is the only reason I felt that way? You lay a ton of accusations about me and my type of personality throughout your entire post, while you also give your own reasons as to why I thought a certain way. Hilarious.   > That's what his personality is like. Sorry, not sorry. That's the truth. It's also because it's his job as the Shepherd. He isn't totally irrelevant to the situation. It's his damn role to purify malevolence from creatures the moment he chose to be the Shepherd. If he can find a way to purify a Dragon, why wouldn't he?  Except he was strictly told by not one, not two, but three Seraphs (one of which was the Dragon's own sister) that it wasn't possible and that the Dragon needed to be killed. Yet he still went so far out of his way to find a way to purify the Dragon. But I agree with you, albeit the condescending tone you've taken (and that I have similarly taken) is disgusting, that his personality is just like that. I'm not condemning him for doing his job, it's just that I feel like his character (along with everyone else in the series) hasn't been developed enough, so even if his personality is like that, it doesn't make it more believable to me. On the other hand, if it was someone like, say Fate Series Spoilers.   I know what you'll probably say, \"This dragon scene is supposed to be what develops him, so you're complaining about development?\". No, I am complaining that it feels like we went 0 to 100 in terms of showing how much he cares about people.   > That has absolutely nothing to do with being an \"anime-only viewer\" or not. It just means you hate those type of characters and can't identify with passionate characters that likes to help out strangers. It means just that. Nothing to do with whether you played the game or not.  Dang really? I didn't know I hated those type of characters! Thank you so much for showing me the way, Mr. Arm-chair psychologist. Seriously though, it seems like I hit a nerve when I complained about this anime, and so now you feel the need to take this extremely personally and lay even more accusations on me. I already gave an example of a passionate character who I wouldn't have quarrels with if they helped out a stranger, so clearly you don't know anything and are just continuing your ad hominem attacks because I gave my opinion on an anime you enjoyed - which you can't defend so you just attack me.

When people point the finger at Jihad, they are mostly confronted with the idea that Christians have tarnished history with the crusades.

I actually do give points to faiths that have fewer calls to violence in their holy texts, so for what it's worth, I acknowledge that yours may not be as bad as others.  > History of blatantly prescribed violence by Christianity pales pretty heavily compared to the historic and present actions of radical Islam.  I'll readily give you this point as well. Believe me - in a possible conflict that would pit Islam against the west, you and I would be standing shoulder-to-shoulder.  Now - have you ever asked yourself why the difference between current levels of violence and sexism in Catholicism and Islam? Consider that the root difference is attributable to the holy texts themselves. I contend that means that the contents of the books actually matters - therefore a lot of the bad behaviour in any religion actually can be attributable to perversions caused by the texts themselves, not just perversions of them by delinquent followers. Sure, your religion may not be as bad as others in this respect, but there's still going to be some of this going on since you're exalting a bronze-age book as the be-all end-all of morality.  Edit response to your first edit: My question on the arbiter was actually more rhetorical.

Thousands and thousands of dead gay kids would probably disagree too...if they were still here and had a voice.  So that proves my point. You were being taught by people that you were unworthy and basically a piece of crap (that's what I'm getting from what you were saying), and your reaction to this was to kill yourself.  Who tried to kill you? Yourself. You are a person, correct?  What gave you the push to do that? Well, according to psychologists, yourself again. But for the sake of argument, let's say it was the idea that you are worthless and unacceptable in life. But where did that idea come from?  A person. I don't know if that person was someone close to you, or a preacher, or a youth leader, or someone else. But it was a person. They pushed you to do that, either directly or indirectly.  And there's something else you must understand about Christian teachings and the Bible. The Bible does say that homosexual acts are a sin, yes. But the Bible also says that lying is a sin.  So who has ever told a lie? I certainly have, I would be lying if I said I never did. I'm about 99.99% certain that everyone has told one at one point or another.   So lying is a sin, and so is homosexual acts. Great, now we've established that:  I am inferring from what you said that Homosexuals are not accepted by Christians, and thus not accepted within churches. Please correct me if I am wrong for inferring that.  But if that is true, does it not follow that anyone who lies is not accepted into Christian churches? Or anyone who is a prostitute, or people who are jealous over something, or anyone who has ever stolen anything (which is probably just about everyone again, even if it was something small)?  If this were the case, then churches would be empty.  I'm not sure what denomination of Christianity you came across, but they are wrong and probably hypocrites. If they can tolerate liars in their church, then they can tolerate homosexuals. And that's what my church does. We don't teach that homosexuals are sub-human, or wretched and sinful, no. We teach that they are human, and have the rights to salvation just like the liar does.  The point isn't that humans don't deserve salvation, the point is that we don't deserve it but we receive it anyway, thanks to the mercy of God.   And, a source for this -  Matthew 21:31, Jesus himself speaking:  \"Which of the two obeyed his father?\" They replied, \"The first.\" Then Jesus explained his meaning: \"I tell you the truth, corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom of God before you do.  [SEP] >So that proves my point. You were being taught by people that you were unworthy and basically a piece of crap   Yes, this is the core of Christian theology. I see it reiterated on this board over and over, and even in your post that I quote later down in my response here. (Forget the whole gay thing too...I'm just talking about how anti-human Christianity is at its core.)   >But where did that idea come from?A person. I don't know if that person was someone close to you, or a preacher, or a youth leader, or someone else. But it was a person. They pushed you to do that, either directly or indirectly.  Well sure. But the ideas of humans being worthless sinners is built into Christianity. If we are really trying to get technical and play semantics (as you seem wont to do), yes ideas come from people. But how do you think Christianity is heard and spread and absorbed? Through people. So fine. People gave me the idea and people invented Christianity...it makes no difference. If you don't get the main point of why Christianity is so harmful to gay people, and you want to try and talk simply about individuals and pull the blame away from the theology, then there is no point in continuing the discussion.    > So lying is a sin, and so is homosexual acts. Great, now we've established that: >I am inferring from what you said that Homosexuals are not accepted by Christians, and thus not accepted within churches. Please correct me if I am wrong for inferring that..  You have oversimplified it and compared being gay to someone who lies. That tells me you do not understand the nature of the subject at hand. I always hear these kinds of ernest but incorrect comparisons from Christians. They say \u201call sins are equal\u201d but don\u2019t act like it and there is no burden placed on a straight person so heavy as they try to impose on gay people: \u201cYou are ok as long as you live your life alone!\u201d   At any rate, the conversation has drifted. I still maintain (and so does empirical research actually) that calling gay people sinners for being gay is extremely damaging no more moral than calling a black person cursed for their skin color. (Remember that is how the Southern Baptists were formed BTW: As an offshoot to protect and biblically defend slavery.) Research shows time and time again this kind of rejection of the whole person (for that is what it is) leads to depression and suicide.   >We teach that they are human, and have the rights to salvation just like the liar does.  There you go again. Saying that someone lying and being gay are moral equivalents. It is a stunningly cavalier, condescending and cruel comment to make and my guess is you have never had very many conversations with gay folks over it. I could be wrong, but that is my strong suspicion. It is clear you do not understand that there is no measurable way to \u201chate the sin love the sinner\u201d with regard to gay folks. It amounts \u201chate the person\u201d though I know there is no way for you to understand that and you probably still wonder why we feel this way.   Any distinction you try to come up with between being gay and \u201cacting on it\u201d is totally arbitrary and relies on made up ideas and imaginary lines in the sand. For instance: Is a gay 5th grader with a crush being sinful for thinking fondly about his classmate or smiling when they talk to them? How about if a 9th grader falls in love with his best friend? What if they talk? Hold hands? Hug? Kiss? See what I mean? These distinctions Christians have tried to create between being gay and \u201cacting on it\u201d aren\u2019t real and not accepting gay people for who we are leads to mountains of misery and thousands of dead kids.

On timber mill (an wow this is your example for the longest map?) there are so many spots where you can cover; the uper left and right sides of the point where there are 2 levels one on the roof and one below; where you are COMPLETELY COVERED from kinessa unless she moves out of position.  And if you andro took 3 enemy people ur team isnt camping the point; unless they are retards; if ur point is secured, you should be moving ahead to keep enemy off the point; you should always start by backing up your tank not ur flank;   Once you take control over the point the team will naturally move to keep the enemies off of it with someone in the back capturing it (unless you play retard and have the whole team sit on point waiting to get fked, given ur logic that wouldn't surprise me)  Like I mentioned; there is loadout card for hp so wasting a legendary on Soul Colector is senseless; and mortal reach is extra range you don't need; you can POSITION yourself all maps have covers; EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!  And whats with this: \"Some maps are longer than you think\"? I have more than 400 hours playing this game what kind of an argument is that?  And yes you can use Shadow Travel to avoid flanks which has a 14 second cooldown and keeps you safe for 4 second after which you are completely vulnerable; OR get agony and secure the kill on that flank yourself on a 10 Sec cooldown;  Agony is also great for stunning enemy champions (again you mostly heal and not fire; but it takes 4 shots to get a stun and w the heal cooldown or before the fight begins its easy to blanket the point with ur orbs);   Nando wants to shield? you stun him and his shield is on cooldown; which also work makoa an other tanks who can be disabled in the middle of a skill w that stun. But somehow range is better? Are you serious?  AND FINALLY; for that HUGE counter; is it bad if your team is getting resilience to counter ur stun when that means he is getting no damage reduction against your team with either Haven or Blast Shield?

That I also position myself and some maps aren\u2019t an instant-brawl like Frog Isle. examples, since I continue to give proof:  \u2022 ice mines on the pushes \u2022 timber mill literally anywhere  \u2022 snowfall junction (also always has snipers;p) \u2022 complete opposite sides of magistrates \u2022 serpent isles is long \u2022 jaguar falls on the sides  \u2022 stone keep has its moments \u2022 brightmarsh on pushes, healing from door \u2022 frozen guard has long paths \u2022 splitstone quarry, another sniper heaven (that\u2019s three maps with lots of sniper coverage and long ranges) and ultimately proving a lot of use for mortal reach.  >shield  Yes, agony can delete shields. You\u2019re saying this as if I didn\u2019t play her with this specific legendary card for months. Something important to note is that if the tank was not smart enough to shield elsewhere or when he didn\u2019t have your soul stacks appearing on screen, then he deserves to be punished and can probably be punished without a stun.   >And yes you can use Shadow Travel to avoid flanks which has a 14 second cooldown  Hold on. You\u2019re acting as if that\u2019s meager. Nobody in the game has a set escape for four second straight. Moji is two seconds, zhins billow has to be increased, as well does grohks. Seris turns invisible and invincible. You can adjust her cards to heal and increase speed in shadow travel so when you come out you\u2019re in a completely different location. Not to mention, a healing card she has allows her channel to reduce shadow travel for a certain amount per second. I usually do this as 1 second reduced per 1 second channeling restore soul. Pretty beneficial to make that 14 second cooldown disappear and then you have another shadow travel ready in half that time.   > AND FINALLY; for that HUGE counter; is it bad if your team is getting resilience to counter ur stun when that means he is getting no damage reduction against your team with either Haven or Blast Shield?  Beautiful. You know you\u2019re pretty much right, they are not reducing any damage taken. But what if your team lacks DPS and you went agony because you thought you would be a better flanker and position yourself so well you can heal at the same time too? They buy resilience and your stubs are useless, your 200 damage an orb is too slow to chip damage away, and you aren\u2019t healing enough because you\u2019re trying to fight! Resilience is an answer to Agony and once you leave Gold you\u2019re going to find that out the hard way.  > Playing with shit flanks who complain that they get no heal is annoying and characters who won't flex (ex.

We are a nation of immigrants and that can cause friction.     \u2022 European countries are ethnically homogenous. This is, to me, one of the most interesting trends in the data. A number of now-global ideas about the nation-state, about national identity as tied to ethnicity and about nationalism itself originally came from Europe. For centuries, Europe's borders shifted widely and frequently, only relatively recently settling into what we see today, in which most large ethnic groups have a country of their own. That developed, painfully, over a very long time. And while there are still some exceptions \u2013 Belgium has ethnic Walloons and Dutch, for example \u2013 in most of Europe, ethnicity and nationality are pretty close to the same thing.  http   > Yes the problem is that your mass shootings kill way more than acid attacks  No shit moron.

Thought you'd do that. :)   Saudi Arabia - Not treason and we both know it. You aren't being much of a lawyer. I'd love to see the looks you would get trying to bring that in to court. There's no wikileak connecting a specific businessman with specific support for al queda. There is the well known fact that factions in Saudi Arabia (even within the house of saud) support al queda and a well known fact that the US does business with Saudi Arabia. 1) No one needed a wiki leak to know those facts. 2) That does not constitute treason, just a shitty world with a necessity for real politik.   Spying UN international law - As you will happily be told by anyone with knowledge, there is no constitutional requirement to obey international law (well, customary international law. Ratified treaties are enforceable under US law). Espionage is also a normal part of statecraft. It is not remotely unconstitutional.   Cluster bombs - this is a UK internal problem concerning a treaty to which the US is not a signatory. Not unconstitutional.   Bombing of Yemen - authorised by Congress through the Authorisation of the Use of Military Force Resolution. Non remotely unconstitutional. You can look through this thread for other commentary on that (ctrl+F AUMF) or just google. The fact that the US is letting the Yemeni government take credit\/blame for it is not unconstitutional.   Kidnapping - This was the one I agreed with. Everything about extraordinary rendition and detainment without trial is likely in violation of the constitution. We hardly needed Wikileaks to tell us about this though. Al-Masri was in the Los Angeles Times on 2008 and it's a matter of public record.   You want to find constitutional violations so you are bending the law and the facts to fit what you want to see. I have the advantage of not caring. I'm just looking at the facts on the ground.    [SEP] >Not treason and we both know it  How condescending of you to note.   And you don't think a specific case could be brought against those in the US government who continue to fund elements in both Saudi Arabia and ISI despite widespread knowledge about hostile use of our contributions? We'll have to disagree. The practicalities of such a prosecution can be debated, but any person continuing to conduct business with an entity funding a hostile fraction is giving comfort and aid to the enemy.  And as you will be told by anyone who isn't simultaneously extremely arrogant and possessed of the notion that their interpretation of law is the only correct one, there is a constitutional requirement that the US obey law ratified by Congress as defined by Article VI (that bit you put about ratification shouldn't have been in parentheses. Parentheses are for qualifications of data, not for making assertions which contradict sentential points). The unconstitutionality of the act doesn't lie in the mere acquisition of information. The NSA's unauthorized wiretapping of US citizens has already been ruled unconstitutional, so the application of existing precedents regarding constitutionality of any wiretapping outside of Headquarters depends on any surveillance of American staffers working for the UN (particularly the UNAEC). DNA samples and financial information are a different beast entirely and may be covered by Federal Criminal Code anyway. But the real catch is the illegality of any activity that took place on the grounds of UN Headquarters. As you'll find, the UN Headquarters Agreement was ratified by the 80th Congress and explicitly prohibits, under Article III Section 9 (among others), US agencies from performing official agency duties or seizing personal property on Headquarters property without the consent of the UN. There are also other specifications for diplomatic immunity pursuant to agreements at Vienna.  So for all your arrogant condescension, you seem to have missed the fact that the conventionality of espionage in \"statecraft\" does not imply legality.   You're correct about the Cluster bombs- some of the rhetoric by US politicians against Israeli use of cluster munitions mislead me into thinking the US had signed the CCM treaty.  Actually, Section 2 of the Joint Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution specifies that nothing within the resolution supersedes the War Powers Act. Which is why the US Congress had to authorize the use of force in Iraq past 90 days despite the Executive's classification of Iraq as a \"terrorist state\" prior to the assault. This required adherence to the War Powers Act is why international observers have noted that the US's continued armed presence (by nonmilitary agencies, I might add) in Pakistan and Yemen is legally problematic.   Glad to see that we agree here. However, there is one very real difference between your position and mine- Al-Masri's kidnapping is judicially covered by State Secrets, which effectively means that government employees don't have to give away any evidence which might lead to self-incrimination. So we essentially had no admissible official evidence regarding Al-Masri at the time. The Wikileaks documents, on the other hand, constitute official confirmation in a variety of ways.

But, I think you are overestimating how difficult it is to find that time and money. 6 months costed me around $7000 including flights and the costs to become a divemaster, which was about $2000. I could have done it much cheaper. I know a guy who was traveling for about $300 a month by sleeping in a hammock and hitchhiking everywhere. As far as time goes, as long as you don't have kids I really don't see a reason you couldn't find even a month or 2 to go traveling. It might cost you more because you might have to pay for your car to be parked somewhere while you're gone, or because you have to pay your rent for those months you are gone, or even be able to make your student loan payments while overseas, but it's doable.

Both restaurants were basically converted garages with just a family running it.

It's a custom around here.  >Do you know what that word means? I am not projecting anything.  It's a clear sign that someone is projecting when they have absolutely no basis in reality to make such broad and insulting assumptions about a person.

I agree with you that life is amazing. I'm not mad at that point and furthermore, that was never your point. All I did was scold you for being so childish in the way you responded to people who like different things in this amazing life. Then you started saying stupid shit like \"I'm angry at their downvotes not their opinions!\" so I talked about that too. Then I responded to your response that I was idiotic and pathetic for holding the opinion that people really are all the same. So then I did what any adult would do, I presented some objective reasoning as to why I hold the opinion. But, like you did for every point I made, couldn't for a single second debate any of them and instead resorted to your now established comfort zone, ad hominems.  >It isn't even close to \"Well I disagree and here's why\".

Yes it is important. If you render into a framebuffer the order in which the pixels get updated is not guaranteed. Tiling, compression, scheduler, tests and more will make sure that when you actually render to a framebuffer that is being scanned out that the result on the screen is garbage.

You made a guess that this might have to do with Nvidia's drivers, which can be a valid guess and Nvidia being a black box that doesn't let me peek inside is something that makes me consider buying an AMD GPU next.

Tiling, compression, scheduler, tests and more will make sure that when you actually render to a framebuffer that is being scanned out that the result on the screen is garbage.  Yes this can happen when updating the content of a buffer using the 3D hardware, i was mostly thinking about dumping pixels however since GUI toolkits seem to do everything on the CPU these days and dump pixels on buffers (i do not really like this approach and i suspect it comes from Wayland's core spec that only defines shared memory surfaces, but whatever, this is how it is done).  In this case you'd probably need some sort of double buffering though, but that shouldn't affect things much as long as the rest of the process isn't also buffered - otherwise you'd get what i wrote previously: an old image made using older images with the output that the user sees being several frames behind.  > The only way to avoid this is to finish rendering and then swap buffers or use the scanout engine to do the compositing.

Capable and competent are extremely different things.  Competent includes a much broader collection of issues than whether someone is sufficiently conscious to utter the word yes at some point, or a thought experiment about what they really wanted and the alcohol made happen. It means if they are in more or less complete control of their actions, aware of their current circumstances, and possessing a reasonable knowledge of the consequences of those actions.  Competency within a legal framework is usually the simplest way to instruct on it since there are uncontroversial examples to use. Someone is not competent when being blackmailed because they are not in control of their actions. A contract cannot be valid when the participants have hid salient details of either one participants current situation (someone not telling a mortgage dealer they are in debt), or the consequences of the contract from each other (hidden fees or misleading claims).  Assuming OP is telling the truth about their alcohol consumption:  Someone who is so shittered that they snap into consciousness unaware of who they are being fucked by (not having sex with, since they are an unequal participant) is not competent to provide consent in that situation.  If she is drunk to the point where she is not in full control of herself (blackout), she is not competent to consent.  If she has unconscious she is no longer competent to consent.  That is his problem with judgement, not hers. Since it's usually really easy to tell if someone is drunk to the point of lacking competence (they'll tell you, smell like it, or be clearly incoherent), he is either a deliberate predator, or an accidental one.  As to your concern about a bright line, there is a bright line: all sex in which one or more partners are not competent is rape. If you doubt the competency of your sexual partner, don't rape them. If you enter into an agreement before hand, while competent, and continue sex where one or more partners are no longer competent, you must acknowledge the risk and you shouldn't do it unless you trust that person not to press charges against you. If you think normal sex involves incompetent people, you need to reevaluate your definition of normal sex, not ask a legal or feminist framework to jump through hoops to accommodate your predatory behaviour.

Saying that there is a clinical correlation between human cocaine use and high risk sexual activity...well there are a LOT of things out there that correlate with increases in high risk sexual activity. Humans almost never use just one drug, they do it at different times and in different amounts. In order to really determine how cocaine specifically impacts sexual behavior, you need to reduce the variables, which means you need a model. Drugs of abuse like cocaine have similar brain effects in various species, so you have your pick, but in this case, quail is a very good choice. While there aren't as many established studies in quail as opposed to, say, rats and mice, quail have a VERY stereotypical mating pattern.  >>The males in particular are highly motivated to mateguard and to mate with female quail. They demonstrate mateguarding by sitting near a female quail and they will do this for hours, even days. This is part of their natural sexual behavior pattern. It is relevant to human behavior in the sense that some drugs, including cocaine, enhance this behavior, thereby modelling the enhanced sexual motivation that occurs with humans during drug use.  >Not only that, while rodents are very strongly influenced by olfactory cues, quail are visually oriented, which makes them, in this way, more similar to humans (though there is some evidence for olfactory cues, and there's some evidence for that in humans as well). You can train them to work with visual cues, and look at motivation to mate using those cues. The scientists have already trained quail in these studies to 'mateguard' in response to a cue signaling a female is about to appear, and have shown that cocaine makes this behavior more difficult to extinguish. These studies can help to show what aspects of sexual behavior are specifically targeted in quail given cocaine, and help us to translate these studies to humans further down the line. The scientists also intend to study both male AND female responses. This is another good reason to use quail, while females do not mateguard, they do \"squat\" to show receptivity, making changes in female sexual response much easier to see (compared to rodents, for example).

Aside from that, our back up is fairly strong. Could do with another back up CB and maybe another top winger. So we could do with 2 big signings.

I had no idea that you didn't know that physical contact between people is something special and private.  I couldn't imagine that you didn't know that concept.  Well then. When you feel close to someone, sometimes, you want to make physical contact with them. This part of a relationship is intimate, meaning that it is only between those two people and not shared with the world. Physical contact is a special thing that typically is done in somewhat private situations. Kissing is an example of a physical contact that might be done in public. Some people sconsider a quick kiss to be appropriate and even cute, while the same people wouldn't openly french kiss in public, because that is displaying an intimate part of a relationship in public.  Some people are exhibitionists and want to be seen, some are not.  Those few exhibitionists don't have much public in day to day life. Some voyeurs might want to see them, but these are few and far in between.  Since intimate physical contact between two person is mostly done in private, most people external to the couple don't want to see this intimate contact seen in public. It puts them in an uncomfortable position because such contact is intimate and is seen as private.  Some people think that this private and intimate contact should be forced upon others when they don't want to see it. The keyword here is \"forced\" and I use it in an extreme manner. Of course those exhibitionists don't think that they are forcing their public, merely doing something extremely personal in front of others that could \"look away\".  Since the vast majority of people understand that being in a closed room with other entails actually not offending others (or making them look away), they will refrain from public displays of affection.  Now the workplace. Most workplaces have multiple people coexisting under various circumstances, most of which include sharing enclosed spaces with people which are not friends or family. 100% of these people are there in order to gain a salary.  Making various types of people work together is a complicated thing. Physical and moral limits have to be put in place because surprisingly, some people don't want to \"fit in\" and take their coworkers limits into consideration.  Most would agree that physical displays of affection are a private thing, only shared between two very close people.   The very intimate action of touching a loved one can put other at unease. Some of those could be uneasy because they recently have had their heart broken so there suddenly is emotional turmoil when they're trying to work, preventing them from focusing on work, the reason they are there for.  Other uneasy people might be people that have received unwanted physical contact in their lives and since about 1 women in 5 have had to go through this at one point or other in their life, it's quite easy to see why intimate and private physical contact might disturb them.  Most people would agree that \"minding\" their coworker's limits and desires is an intricate part of having to work together.   Still some people believe that their own viewpoint trumps collective agreement. Does people then are seen as inconsiderate of others.  They don't want collective limits put in place. They can't conceive that their own desires are not accepted by people around them. no matter which way you are trying to explain to them that private and intimate physical contact should not be forced upon their coworkers, they don't give a damn. They want the world to spell out to them each and every way that other people ARE offended. They cannot conceive that some people might be inconvenienced without asking them about it.  Some might even think that it would be a good thing that their personal limits should apply or be debated. They are so close minded that people with different standards to them are \"assholes\" and \"stupidly offended\".  Those people are assholes.  To prevent those people from causing chaos and trouble in the workplace, we have to put rules in place to force these people to adhere to a reasonnable amount of social limits that pleases most.  [SEP] >Oh. I had no idea that you didn't know that physical contact between people is something special and private  Wow, it's almost like you couldn't wait to be completely condescending, good on you!  And actually, it really isn't. Despite your wall of text, you start with a flawed premise. Hugs are far from private, intimate contact. I would hug a friend if I saw them on the street. I would hug a stranger on the street (or pretty much anywhere) if they were sad and said they needed a hug. Ditto a pat\/rub on the back. Not so for a kiss, a grope, or a quick shag.   And the main point of contention here is where that line is drawn. You seem incredulous that anyone would think that handshakes should fall under this, that would just be crazy! But you won't even brook any possibility that maybe you're in the minority in being made uncomfortable by a hug or a rub on the back.  Despite all that, you actually managed to make a halfway decent point!  >Some of those could be uneasy because they recently have had their heart broken so there suddenly is emotional turmoil when they're trying to work, preventing them from focusing on work, the reason they are there for.  This is a decent point, but still not one I'm particularly convinced about. For instance: My father just died, and I get some significant emotional turmoil from hearing about people going out and spending time with their fathers. This is kind of an understandable thing, and I've asked my co-workers if they could refrain from talking about their dads (as much as possible), and they've been accommodating for the most part.  What didn't happen, was that there wasn't a rule put in place that talking about your family in the workplace was no longer allowed.  I actually, despite your delusions to the contrary, fully understand that I need to make modifications to my behavior when I'm out in public, and that what concessions I do and do not make reflect upon my character.  What I am disputing is the need for blanket rules, to the point of firing someone for something as innocuous as a quick rub to the back during a stressful time, between a couple or even between friends.  What I am saying is that if someone is triggered emotionally by normal human behavior then it's on them to make reasonable accommodations and talk to their co-workers.  What I reject is the blanket notion that touching someone at the workplace is always inappropriate, because it's just not.  There are tons of other ways that this could be dealt with.  I would, and have, hugged co-workers who normally worked remote goodbye as they left, if that was their preferred greeting\/farewell gesture.

Only to a degree. They're free to make their own judgment, as any person is, but shit talking and shaming people for showing interest is childish, disgusting, and frankly inhuman.

So, if Helen couldn't do something as relatively simple as bring a notepad and pen to a hearing person unfamiliar with signing, it's no surprise she'd think that.   (Also, quite frankly, I'd imagine that blind people back then might've been nicer and more tolerant than their deaf counterparts. Even today we can get pretty... cliquey and very \"us vs. them\", and that's not what Helen would have wanted.)  Lastly, it really annoys me too that hearing people find her so fascinating simply because she lost two of her five senses, and managed to get past society's designated ideas of deaf-blind people as senseless beasts. It's certainly encouraging for us who are deaf or blind (in that we know it's possible as well to get out of society's condescending, ableist clutches), but in the end, she always had that potential regardless of disability or not, and it's silly to see her as deaf-blind first and smart, empathetic, accomplished, driven, successful second.   It's funny, really. They might be inspired by her, but the majority of them wouldn't have been able to do as well as her anyway no matter what. Talent like that can't just be acquired, and you don't \"have a bigger chance to be like Helen Keller\" just because you can hear\/see. (Talking about general you here) Like, goddamn, she wasn't perfect but other than her biased view of the Deaf, she was very close to it.

The author is lamenting the poor souls who are pigeon-holed into the often made up hop- tastic epicenter of craft\/micro brews. Oh woe is them! Hops have such a pungent taste and odor, and these weary patrons are forced to imbibe only the IBU-est of concoctions.   Give me a fucking break. I know this article was written in 2013, but seriously, what a joke. Oh, you're friend doesn't like hoppy beers? It must be impossible to find beer from the puny list of barleywines, blondes, browns, wheats, porters, stouts, wilds, creams, spiced, fruit, smoked, Belgian strongs, dubbels, trippels, quads, saisons, wits, lambics, goses, guezes, English sweet stouts, imp stouts, dunkels, Berliner Weiss, weizenbocks, kolschs, scotch wee heavys, pils, bocks, zwickels, scharz, viennan, Asian rice lagers, and steams. What's that? That list is longer that you thought? Well that's because you can't think because you're a fucking moron.  There are now more than 3,000 breweries in the U.S.. You know how many existed just 30 years ago? Around a fucking hundred. 1 0 0. There is more choice and variation now than there ever was. Oh, but what about the 4,000 breweries that existed before in the 1800s? Yeah, did they have access to the giant multitude of hop varieties that we have now? What about the crazy yeast strains we're able to cultivate? Fuck you. Beer now is exponentially more varied than it ever was before. Can't find a beer you like? Either you're not looking hard enough, or you don't like beer (sucks to suck!).  Oh, and calling a beer \"hoppy\" is also fucking stupid. Hops can be tropical, juicy, aromatic, flowery, lemony, minty, and a million other fucking things. None of those are \"bitter\" (which is what I think the author is getting at).

It isn't some arduous task to find a quality, affordable beer in the U.S. anymore that fits your most likely limited scope of preferred taste. While introductory brewers might jump to adding more hops to a beer in the hopes of making it better, true craftsmen hone their skills toward yeast cultivation, wood and barrel aging and other things that require a lot more chemistry knowledge. The beer industry should not cater towards your palate at the expense of others.

Let me try to break my viewpoint down for you:  For decades, Sean Hannity has been a successful media personality. I've not always agreed with what he believes, but I've always respected his right to believe it. With regards to the lunatic conspiracy that has him in trouble currently, he is continuing to persist on a story that a) his network, b) the 'investigator' that some crackpot hired, and c) law enforcement have all either disavowed their statements on (with regards to a and b) or have never found anything more than a tragic botched robbery in (with regards to c).   It is this persistence to pursue a story that literally no one believes has substance anymore outside of those who believe in lunatic conspiracies like pizzagate that has him losing the support of his advertisers.  Let me be clear-- his advertisers would likely stick around no problem if he behaved in the manner of someone like Tucker Carlson (who I also disagree with but have immense respect for). Instead, he is sounding increasingly deranged, pushing baseless conspiracies, flying in the face of the wishes of his family, the finding of all experts, and ignoring the beliefs\/statements of his own network.  It is not unreasonable at all that people are upset that this man continues to essentially harass the Rich family about this story in the national media.

Here's the thing:  There are completely different levels of \"racism\", and I think that you're missing one or more of them in your \"racism\" definition.   In fact, based on how strongly you're defending the BLM\/Sanders thing as \"not racist\", I think you might not have much more than one single level of racism in mind, and it's this one.  What I mean is, somehow, \"racism\" and \"racist\" have turned into this absolute for a lot of people. That is, if you do racist things, you are a racist, and if you're a racist, you're not much better than the people in the photo above. People that share this belief therefore tend to see \"racist\" as an attack to be defended against (as you are doing, which is why I think you might feel that way).   There is, however, a difference between being \"racist\" and \"a racist\", between being \"racist\" and sometimes doing things that are racist, and even between being actively racist and accidentally racist.   Like, well, almost everything in life, racism (and all forms of bigotry, really) are on a spectrum.  Racism is not limited to using the word \"nigger\" casually and burning crosses. It's not even limited to thinking other races are dumber\/uglier\/otherwise worse than your own. In this case, it's something as simple as a bunch of white people (and I will freely admit, I was one of them for a short period) getting frustrated because a group of minorities wouldn't just get in line and support the white guy that we know is best choice for them.   The idea of knowing better than someone else \"what's best\" for that person is intrinsically condescending, as it's something usually said in the context of how a parent acts on behalf of their child, who lacks the agency, experience or intelligence to decide for themselves what is \"best\" for them.   Using that phrase when discussing an adult is degrading. Using it when discussing a whole race is ... I think you know.  Our society legitimately needs to pump the brakes on the idea that \"racist\" is this horrible insult. On both sides, frankly. Far too many people use \"racist\" as an insult, which just propagates taking it as such. We all have some racism inside of us. It is threaded so tightly into our society, it's all but impossible not to. That's not good, but it's a fact of life.   Getting defensive and trying to hide behind claiming that something we did isn't racist doesn't change whether or not it was; it simply prevents us from learning and growing. I get it. If you consider yourself a good person, and consider \"racism\" to be this black-and-white \"evil\", it can be uncomfortable as hell to be confronted with the idea that you did something \"racist\". In actuality, unintentional racism (and being informed of it) is an opportunity for us to fight societal racism on an individual scale.   Anyway, good chatting with you.

I already know you're American, because only an American could believe something this fucking stupid, but let's look at some other possible nations first.  The UK. Here's a right-wing source for you as well. Many Sikhs were admitted during the 1950s, and immigration was more heavily regulated but there was no ban on 'Non-white immigration' as you claim.  Onto Canada, where the source is a lot simpler to explain. Without just copy-pasting the whole thing, some important points are:  The 1901 Canadian Census:  >Census.(1) Of the 5,371,315 population in Canada, 684,671 (12.7%) were immigrants (i.e. born outside Canada). 57% of the immigrants were male. About a quarter of the immigrant population had arrived in the previous 5 years. 57% of immigrants were born in the British Isles, 19% in the U.S., 5% in Russia, 4% in Germany and 2.5% (17,043 people) in China. There were 4,674 people born in Japan, 1,222 people born in Syria, 357 people from Turkey, and 699 born in the West Indies. The only African country listed was South Africa (128 people). Of the 278,788 immigrants who were \"foreign-born\" (meaning born outside the British Empire), 55% were naturalized citizens. However, only 4% (668) of the Chinese-born were citizens. In terms of \"origins\", the census counted 17,437 \"Negroes\" in Canada. 42% of the population was of British origin, while 31% was of French origin. There were 16,131 Jews and 22,050 Chinese\/Japanese (given as one category). 96% of the population was of European origin.  Those 22,000 Chinese\/Japanese people did not fall out of the sky, nor were slaves. This proves that immigration was allowed prior to 1901.  1906\/7  >c. 4,700 Indians, mainly Sikhs from the Punjab, arrived in Vancouver. Arrivals of Japanese and Chinese increased (more than 2,300 Japanese arrived in B.C. in 1907). Reaction by white British Columbians was described by the Minister of the Interior as \"almost hysterical\". An \"Anti-Asiatic Parade\" organized by the Asiatic Exclusion League ended in a riot, with extensive damage done to property in Chinatown and the Japanese quarter.  It isn't all sunshine and rainbows though. In 1910 the Canadian government effectively stopped Black Oklahoman farmers from migrating to Canada and the official reason given was:  >\"any immigrant belonging to the Negro race, which race is deemed unsuitable to the climate and requirements of Canada.\"  That's one of the most genuinely racist things I've ever read, it's actually hilarious that about a hundred years ago this racist shit actually passed as mainstream discourse.  1911 Census  > Census. The population of Canada was 7,206,643, of which 22% was composed of immigrants (i.e. born outside Canada). Only 39% of those born outside Canada were female (2% of those born in China, representing 646 women). 49% of immigrants were born in the British Isles, 19% in the U.S., and 6% in Russia. 223 were identified as being born in Africa (outside South Africa), 211 in the West Indies. Of the 752,732 immigrants who were \"foreign-born\" (meaning born outside the British Empire), 47% were naturalized citizens. 9.5% (2,578) of the Chinese-born and 22.5% (1,898) of the Japanese-born were citizens. In terms of \"origins\", the census counted only 16,877 \"Negroes\", 560 fewer than in 1901. 54% of the population was of British origin (up from 47% in 1901), while 29% was of French origin. There were now 75,681 Jews, 27,774 of Chinese origin, 9,021 of Japanese origin and 2,342 were classified as \"Hindu\". 5% of the population had German origins and 1.8% Austro-Hungarian. 97% of the population was of European origin.  The number of non-whites is growing.  >Census. The population of Canada was 8,787,949, of which 22% was composed of immigrants (i.e. born outside Canada). 44% of the immigrant population was female (but only 3% of the Chinese and 32% of the Italians). 82% of immigrants had been in Canada for 10 years or more. 52% of immigrants were born in the British Isles, 19% in the U.S. and 5% in Russia. 1,760 immigrants were born in South Africa; Africa is not otherwise listed as a place of birth. Of the 890,282 immigrants who were \"foreign-born\" (born outside the British Empire), 58% were naturalized citizens. The number of naturalized Chinese-born had decreased from 2,578 in 1911 to 1,766 (representing 4% of the Chinese-born). The number of German-born naturalized citizens had also decreased (from 23,283 in 1911 - before the war - to 21,630). 33% (3,902) of the Japanese-born were citizens. 44% of the immigrant population was rural (but only 40% of female immigrants). In terms of the \"origins\" of the total population, the census counted 18,291 \"Negroes\" in Canada, 126,196 \"Hebrews\", 39,587 people of Chinese origin and 23,342 of Japanese origin. 55% of the population had origins in the British Isles, while 33% was of French origin. 97.5% of the population was of European origin.  The number of non-whites is growing still. It's important to point out that although the percentage of those who are of 'European' origin is quite high, and increases, the number of non-European is also increasing. All I have to prove is that immigration from Western-white nations was allowed, and that's clearly proven here. Feel free to skim through the '31, 41' & 51' censuses to see this continue.  Before we move onto America\u2014on the second page of that source from the year 1961 we see this:  >71,689 immigrants arrived - the lowest level since 1947, and a reflection of the economic recession.  So from 1947 to 1961 at least 71,000 immigrants arrived each year. Some of those were Jews, who aren't 'White-western'\u2014some are Russian, who aren't 'White-western' and obviously you have brown-skinned people as well.  Onto America. As I understand it, the genesis of this 'Non-whites were banned from migrating to western white nations' bullshit originates from America and Americans, and it originates from the 1965 immigration act. That can be found here.  So in reading about this, the first you'll notice is that it replaces a 1952 act, which can be found here and the 1952 act was a bit of a footnote to the 1924 Act found here.  In simple terms, for America during the 1900s to 1965 there was a quota system which allowed legal immigration. The quotas were sometimes hilariously small, however, legal immigration was still allowed. The 1965 Act removed the smaller, per-country quota system and replaced it with a per-hemisphere quota system allowing 140,000 & 170,000 skilled workers.  Your belief that immigration was 'Limited' to Western-White nations is bullshit on all fronts. There was immigration from Asian nations, from non-western white nations, from African nations, from India. A primary reason for the quota system was to prevent immigration from:  >The law was primarily aimed at further decreasing immigration of Southern Europeans, especially Italians; and, to a lesser extent, immigrants from countries with Roman Catholic majorities, Eastern Europeans, Arabs, and Jews.  So prior to 1924, one would assume that these groups could immigrate more freely, and after 1924, with the quota system, some still could\u2014just in smaller numbers.  tl;dr, Don't get your immigration history from a mix of Breitbart, the dailystormer, Black Pigeon speaks, Molyneaux or anyone who argues that Liberalism is anti-immigration.","target":"condescension"},{"text":"\"Saints Row has been a poor man's GTA\"  I personally believe if you even say things like that you're not fan.

Just because this is a fact doesn't mean it is pertinent to discussios of inequality between the sexes, or I'm arguing it shouldn't be addressed.   Yes. It absolutely does, when the disparity is 1000% and there is almost no discussion on again and counseling for suicide victims. Regardless of the reason, male suicide attempts are FAR more successful than females, so every male attempt we prevent through counseling is as effective at reducing the suicide rate (statistically) as preventing 9 to 10 female attempts. So why aren't we assigning special effort to male education and counseling, like we assign special effort for female victims of domestic violence? The numbers support such an approach. Society doesn't.   >I'm not dismissing \"disadvantages\" faced by men, or arguing we should ignore a less disadvanteged group. And you're right it's not a competition.

How can you expect either group to find together if they can't acknowledge one group may actually have it worse?  That didn't make me upset. I can acknowledge that women, by and large, have greater societal disadvantages. I AGREE with that point.  I just don't agree with using it instead of addressing a problem advocated by the other side. That's dismissive. If people opposed injustice where they found it, then those that endured the most injustice would naturally see the most support.   My issue is that male issues get almost no consideration, and most consideration they DO get is couched in some buzzword variant of \"ManBad\" (mansplaining, patriarchy, toxic masculinity, etc) as the actual problem.  There are millions of people like me who feel powerless and voiceless. That's a dangerous combination for cooperation, and it is far more easily solved by acknowledging our pain too.  Yes, women have it shitty. Yes, there is a place for advocating for addressing issues which uniquely or disproportionately affect women. And I can even do it without making up words that have negative connotations and feminine prefixes.  I just want to feel that society as a whole values a man's life as equal to a woman's. And it doesn't. The old notion of \"women and children first\" hasn't been eradicated, and while chivalrous, it represents a societal view that all the woman lives should be saved from certain death, before a single man should. Within that context, the expectation is kinda dehumanizing.  I want to be in the discussion. And too often, it's the feminists that deny that voice.  Yes, there is space for a movement that advocates women's issues. But feminism, as it exists today, isn't that movement.

The problem is in venues that create opportunity. There are a set of laws across this country that severely limit opportunities to earn a living, while at the same time demanding that you must earn a living. An example of these opportunity muting laws are laws that forbid private sales on public property, like street vendors.   I had a personal experience wanting to open an arcade that would create 6-12 jobs, but the amount of hurdle-jumping, fees, red tape and hurdles was just too unbearable (an example was that I had to pay a certified architect $10k to draw up plans of the place just for me to get started). Well, now there's no arcade for me, jobs for 6-12 people or fun contests for my would be arcade.   So, these laws are what I call the Job Funnel.

But there is some clarification to be done here: Concentrate is not all sold under the \"Megapurple\" brand. Megapurple is a concentrate targeted to help increase color. But you can buy concentrate in almost any variety from many regions of California, and a lot of it has nothing to do with the color, it's about adding glucose in fructose and acid in a proportional way.  I think the issue is this, and I've bloviated on this many, many times. The wine industry as a whole is markedly dishonest with its most loyal consumers. I think the reaction to things like Megapurple have more to do with consumers feeling like they're not getting the whole story from an industry where the story is very, very important.   Morevoer, I think that there is a reasonable amount of negativity around a product like Megapurple because the product isn't spoken about honestly and in a straightforward way. I still think there are plenty of reasons to be negative about it, but I think having an open discussion about how it's used would help clear up a lot of myths.   BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I can tell you for a fact that not EVERY wine under $20 uses concentrate. We make quite a few $20 and under wines, we've never released a single wine with concentrate. I can also tell you that I know of many other winemakers who make plenty of wines under $20 that don't use concentrate either. So while it is certainly a practice you might find, it's far less common amongst smaller producers (and I would venture to say it's not \"common\" at all, with the exception of rained out or otherwise weather-busted vintages (this being one of the reasons to chaptalize noted above)).  EDIT: \u2026and at some point you have to start asking yourself how you feel about any and all products and techniques that can be used to make wine. If you wanted to have an \"ethical\" stance on whether using those products and techniques was okay by you or not you'd have to start carrying around a spreadsheet with you. The bottom line is this: do you like the wine? Are you interested in how it's made? Are you more interested in ranking the \"authenticity\" of a wine than you are in the \"enjoyability\" of a wine? Are those different pursuits entirely? Are they discussions of quality or just difference?  I'm not pretending to suggest I have the answer to those rhetorical questions, those are personal and everyone will answer them differently and nobody is wrong. But it's worth the thought experiment.

It means a lot to hear this from a winemaker. You have essentially summed up why there are consumer movements towards \"natural\"(sic), biodynamic, organic, small estate wines. All approaches are inherantly flawed. But the industry has been tone deaf and condescending to calls for more transparency.

I don't think so. I think I am poking fun at the pre-conceptions people bring to Zen, so I might have actually been on especially good behavior here in NOT bringing my own pre-conceptions.   For example, this is a preconception here, of yours:  >Zen texts are meant to point to seeing true nature. They are not a source of information on what is or is not Zen, or how masters behaved.   I guess there are some texts that I would call zen texts, but I think I said \"texts that contain the sayings, stories, cases, and koans\" of folks that are recognizable within the tradition folks like Watts saw as zen. (I still have to repeat that just because an academic says so an so \"is Zen\", to me there has to be a pattern of self mockery or humor, or poking fun at doctrine or poking fun at practice, or some reference to the ineffable, etc. that is characteristic of zen. If they are Sanskrit translators or preach a bunch of flowery doctrine with double adjectives, that's a dead giveaway. Zen was surely not imitating the Indians.)   Why not talk about what shows up as Zen within any given text. With the scarcity of \"zen texts\" we might have to grab the zen where we find it to some degree, even if the text includes other stuff. Most of these texts were collaborations of more than one person over a period of decades or even centuries. Most of the sutras can be dismissed out of hand, so that mostly leaves a few books that were anthologies and some books that were \"sayings of\" kinds of books. Either way, are we not just talking about some sayings, some cases, some stories, some koans? Where is the zen doctrine? There isn't any. If you are looking at doctrine, you are looking at something else, as far as I can tell.  Now, when you read a case, there might be a commentary as well. But most of the time, case, commentary, it leaves one either speechless in the case of someone who came to it empty, or in the case of the Buddhists, they are going to have to drown out both the case and the commentary with about half an hour of interpretation, smoothing it over until the balls are sucked right up into the torso. So it may not be a source of information, but then, where is that source of information? Its the world you live in. The cases are just about seeing. They are often examples of seeing that might be recognized. Or maybe if you don't cut it off, they can show you something, get your own eyes moving. Pointing is not pointing with significance like a Moses would point at the commandments. Pointing is sharing an invitation with no expectation or guarantee.  >You really believe they're sociopathic lunatics?  Put that way, no. But the question behind that is \"do I believe that stuff really happened\". I am sure some of it did, and some of it didn't. Which did and which didn't? Here, the question behind that: \"Would it make any difference if it did or didn't happen?\" No. NOOOOO?!!!!? (I hear swearing?) No. Obviously, it happens all the time that someone figures out that humans are suckers for words, names etc. and see for a bit, or for a lot. It doesn't depend on zen texts. So obviously some of that stuff like Joshu having a three legged chair actually happened, dude, in real life man!!!! And some of it was probably made up, or at least the names of the participants was changed, that is provable in textual examples. But if you read a case, and you get it, I wonder if you knew if it was made up or if it was real would make a difference in zen. I would in Buddhism I bet.

A lot of the dialogues in the suttas sound remarkably similar in how shakyamuni talked and behaved to masters in zen texts. Obviously, it's taken to the same extreme as chan texts, but some of the suttas can be deliciously irreverent. Even the dhammapada has choice passages that distinctly resemble Zen.  > Most of the sutras can be dismissed out of hand,   What makes you think that is so?  > Where is the zen doctrine?

And what makes you so sure the pali canon is that much different from the literature you're describing? If you read Zen literature it's an entirely genius collection of dialogues illustrating Buddhist logic and principles.  > I would in Buddhism I bet.   Lol, thats a pretty lousy bet my friend.

If it's driving you insane then you should totally use the extension, but if it's not something you run up against often, it's handy to know that you can do it without.  Unless I've totally misunderstood, which is always probable. [SEP] > When it says 'Switch to tab', hold Shift as you press Enter to make it Duplicate the tab.  Have you tried this? On what version of Firefox? Because pressing shift there (w\/o the extension installed) opens a new window, not a new tab. That's a different feature.   There are several reasons why this entire \"switch to tab\" mullarkey is a very bad idea from start to finish, and why fixing it is very welcome:  1. The \"switch to tab\" misfeature overrules user intent. It clearly shows that whoever developed that misfeature firmly believes that users are idiots and that they, the develper(s) know better than the user, and that they thought they could make Firefox know better what the user wants than the actual user. That's both condescending and massive hubris.  Any competent user actually wanting to switch to a tab that's already open would simply do so, directly. A user who bothers to type an address anew in a newly-created or existing tab is a user who intends to open that URL in that tab. That's the established paradigm. Breaking the UI pattern by changing the behaviour of only certain URLs (the ones already open in another tab) just to give users another way to do something they already can do (switch tabs) is not just breaking a rule, it's needlessly changing things to be less consistent, for no good reason.  The \"switch to tab\" feature assumes that the user is a blithering eejit who wouldn't know what tabs they have open if they stared them in the face.   2. Without the \"Switch to Tab no more\" extension, it is very hard to avoid the unwanted second-guessing and to actually open the same URL as another tab without switching to it. Not even about:config can rescue competent users from the unwanted intent-hijacking misfeature being rammed down their throat.  3. Security updates and feature changes should be distinct. On Linux systems in particular, it's terrible how a user who just wants the latest security fixes from the update repositories to ensure his system is fully patched keeps getting ambushed with far-reaching feature changes, which in the case of the introduction of the \"switch to tab\" misfeature changed the way the UI worked.  4. The introduction of this new \"switch to tab\" exception to an established UI behaviour pattern breaks a rule and thereby increases complexity, both for the user and the developers and code base. Just because you can add a certain feature doesn't mean you should.  5. Never force people to change ingrained behaviours and to have to relearn and adapt anew to your application unless there's a compelling reason for changing things. Is there something to be gained? Really? And how beneficial is that, especially in light of the cost?   6. We've already established that competent users are more hindered and annoyed by the \"switch to tab\" misfeature. But it's actually worse: Because the sudden change to some other tab is also very confusing to new, less-than-competent users. \"Ooops, now suddenly I'm on a different tab.

Like, a similarly aged Mulder only gets a sheepish glance at himself in the mirror but Scully's age leads her to a midlife crisis about her looks and some yearning for a baby and fears about Mulder finding someone else? Meanwhile, Mulder gets to play it cool?  Honest, sincere question: Wasn't Mulder's own, personal \"mid-life crisis\" already explored quite thoroughly (in more than one instance), though? ...And, in those situations, didn't Scully get the opportunity to \"play it cool\", as well?  More specifically, throughout the Season 10 episode \"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\", Mulder is shown to be quite depressed, frustrated and saddened about his current position\/role in life, and how his life has turned out, in general. (He was also shown to have been experiencing similar depression and frustration in \"My Struggle\", as well as in other episodes.)   Scully responded to Mulder's personal crises in a rather cool, glib and lighthearted fashion, in those scenes, with lines such as, \"Mulder, have you been taking your meds?\", too.  So...well, would it have really improved this episode to have Mulder once again reflect upon his mid-life issues? Or, instead, did the reversal in positions add to the overall feeling of \"balance\" and growth between the characters?  Personally, I thought that the latter was true -- and that things might have become too repetitive, if Mulder were to have rehashed all of the issues that he had previously mentioned. Also, as a woman, I actually found the writing of Scully's character to be quite realistic, in this episode. Nearly every single human being on this planet experiences doubts, regrets and insecurities, at some point in their lives (especially as they grow older); that's a perfectly normal experience, and not something that should be looked upon in a negative or judgmental light. So, why can't Scully be shown to experience doubts, regrets and insecurities, as well?  In addition, the character of Judy really got into Scully's head, so to speak, and deliberately played upon her personal insecurities for malicious reasons. Wouldn't it have been more \"bland\" if Scully didn't react to this trickery, at all, and wasn't susceptible to the same self-doubts that the majority of people, in real life, are?  Your opinion is totally valid, of course, and I honestly don't mean to sound dismissive or disrespectful; I just find the comments about Scully and Mulder's crises to be very interesting, really. Some fans have mocked Mulder for his mid-life crisis, and others seem to be implying that Scully shouldn't be experiencing such a crisis, at all. Perhaps it's more of a reflection of people (in general)'s subconscious unwillingness to face the fact that, no matter how perfect and well-adjusted they are, they will likely have to struggle with severe self-doubt, insecurities and regret, at some stage in their lives? That one day they, too, will have to look back upon their lives in a way that they were never forced to, before -- and that they might not be thrilled with what they see?  I don't know if that's the case, but it's been intriguing to read everyone's reactions to how Mulder and Scully, as characters, are personally coping with the aging process...    [SEP] I appreciate your thoughtful response. Admittedly, I forgot about Darin Morgan's episode from last season -- that story just evaporated in my memory for some reason. I'm not so sure having one character fret while one character plays it cool is best. I don't think that's the solution, regardless of who is fretting.   Perhaps it would have been a tad redundant to have Mulder demonstrate his own insecurities in this episode. I do think Mulder's concerns could have reemerged in the recent episode without seeming derivative. In either case, neither character's concerns were substantively investigated. Mulder's placid manner set against Scully's fretting just didn't achieve much interest and there was an air of condescension to the writing. Mulder came across as obnoxious and I don't think that was the intent.   >severe self-doubt, insecurities and regret, at some stage in their lives?  These words suggest a level of depth that I didn't quite see in Carter's script. Anderson and Duchovny brought more weight to their lines than Carter probably imagined. Good acting, to be sure. However, some elements seemed beyond saving. Scully's line about how \"a woman thinks about these things,\" for instance. That bit seems to suggest her insecurities are a gendered phenomenon rather than something more generally applicable. I don't mean to collapse genders here, or suggest there aren't distinct worries, but that line seemed sloppily conceived and it felt like Carter's patronizing and stereotypical attempt at envisioning a woman's problems. Adding Mulder's seeming nonchalance about his own appearance didn't contradict this condescending vibe.  I found Carter's conception of a woman's midlife crisis to be so cliched. The emphasis on her appearance and motherhood, I mean. This is not to say that such issues are not valid concerns, or credible parts of the process of growing old, but it was a bit uncreative, and has been shown in so many other films and shows (including this one).   So, yeah, it seemed like Carter was sleepwalking through that part. None of it quite distinguished itself through new nuance or perspective. Alas, this stuff also follows a premiere in which Carter reduced Scully's agency in ridiculous ways while turning Mulder into a man of action. I just don't think he's been giving her character a lot to work with lately.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"> Existence of the self is a philosophical question,  Thats silly, I can touch and feel myself, therefore my experience tells me that I exist.

Neither of our theories hold true. Debate on both theories is therefore still open.  > I also take issue with \"the initiating catalyst is termed god\".   In my experience (i.e. empiric data point), when people talk about the initiating catalyst to existence, it's framed as god.

For example, the theory of gravity is true if I drop an apple and it falls to the ground.  I don't mean to sound condescending, but you clearly have no clue what a scientific theory is.   What you've just described is the law of gravity. The theory of gravity is the explanation for why gravity works the way it does. This theory is supported by evidence. We say \"we think gravity works because of X, Y, and Z\", and then we test situations that we've never seen before, but which are predicted by the theory. If our test confirms our predictions, then we say that the theory is validated. Theories are never, ever, ever proven, though. You can only validate or disprove theories.  >I don't have to cover for every instance you can conceive of, because if you did, then you can't prove that evolution works prior to the big bang either.  I've mentioned this before, but it seems like you completely ignored me. Evolution has nothing to do with the big bang. Why do you keep bringing the big bang into the discussion of evolution when the two are not related at all?  I keep bringing it up because your argument is about the creation of the universe. My argument, however, is about evolution, so the big bang stuff is irrelevant to my side of the debate.  >In my experience (i.e. empiric data point)  That's not what \"empiric data point\" means. A data point is something that you measure, not just something that you experience. But I'll let it slide for now because there is more interesting stuff to address.  >when people talk about the initiating catalyst to existence, it's framed as god.   So? That has nothing to do with anything. The question is about what actually exists, not what lots of people think exists. Empirical data concerning this topic would require that you measure god him\/her\/itself. Empirical data is about things that exist, not things that people believe.   If your argument were \"lots of people believe in god\", then your data would be relevant. But your argument is \"god exists\", so you need empirical data about this god entity itself, and not about what other people believe about the entity.  I'll say this again, and I'm honestly trying not to be condescending, but your comments have made it clear that you don't really know what the theory of evolution is, and you don't even really know what a scientific theory is.

I think $3-$5 for a digital skin (4-600 gems, depending on the quantity you bought) provides HiRez with a more than reasonable profit over 10,000 or so buyers (probably on the low end).

And yes, it is possible for companies to sustain themselves without resorting to unfair practices - more than one way to skin a cat, if you will.  [SEP] Unfortunately it's not up the customer whether the profit margin is reasonable. If a game is by all measures healthy, why would they eliminate chests (that aren't doing any harm other than people being upset they can't buy ~~certain~~ many skins) and sacrifice significant revenue?  Ultimately this boils down to the fact that the game is supporting itself fine, players are not being driven away by chests (certainly some are deterred from buying, but likely outweighed by whales\/completionists), so the business practices are supporting the game even if the skins aren't being sold in the friendliest way possible.  > Someone makes an opposing point and they\u2019re \u201chysterically arguing,\u201d you find an issue with something they say and you find it \u201cdisgusting.\u201d  Heh, couldn't think of a better word on the spot.

Tell ya what, though, I will quote one line from your last the give you a head start:  >\u201cIs measurement error not a byproduct of calculations?\u201d  Ready? Okay, on 3. 1... 2... Go! [SEP] > You fail to recognize that what motivates you to continue this conversation need not be well aligned with what motivates me to do the same, and thus what counts as \u201cproductive\u201d with respect to my motivations need not necessarily seem \u201cproductive\u201d with respect to yours.  How should I expect to know what your motivations are? I can only speak from my own point of view, though I generally approach each conversation with the desire for mutually beneficial knowledge gain. Unfortunately as is often the case, and indeed seems to be here, if one party becomes overly condescending and confident in their own knowledge or views, it becomes a rather unidirectional spiral of attack\/defense. I was trying to avoid such a scenario, but appear to have failed.   > So what? If you compute a long-term prediction but have to admit at the outset that you don\u2019t know how long it will actually remain accurate because you can\u2019t possibly know whether or not there is anything that will eventually become relevant that has not been accounted for in the computation, it seems rather silly to imagine that prediction as a \u201cperfect\u201d one. \u2026on the pitfalls of waxing quantum with only a cursory, popsci-level comprehension of the subject  Your confidence and condescension is such though that I feel I could gain little from arguing further here. I'll simply say that, as I've hinted or directly posited many times, I would not expect a full understanding of how the universe interacts to yield a situation where we \"can't possibly know\" when a non-local variable can come into play. I interpret our current gaps in understanding as incomplete not foundational, which is the whole point of the argument.   > I don\u2019t know where you got this idea from. It is well-established that the nonlocal behavior associated with quantum theory cannot be harnessed to exchange information at superluminal speeds.  Again, the proposition I'm proposing is that what nature does technology should likewise be able to do. Yes we have no way to communicate faster than light (though I'd caution you against speaking as though actively developing theories and experiments are \"well established\"), and indeed that may be the natural barrier it appears to be. If this were the case, then we wouldn't expect non-local variables to be able to violate this law. Hence technology could perfectly predict nature, in theory.   > Well, for one thing, the mathematical structure of the uncertainty principle applies to specific pairs of noncommutable variables (e.g. position versus momentum; spin up versus spin down; etc). There is nothing in the uncertainty principle per se that directly precludes the possibility of simultaneously measuring, say, spin and momentum.  This seems more of a nuance than a game-changer concerning my original propositions, but thanks for clearing that up. It was a misrepresentation (not a \"gross\" one, but now who's playing semantics...). With that correction, how should my view change? This still speaks to an epistimological barrier no?  > Here\u2019s the thing, though: It doesn\u2019t matter how precise you think your wording is, because regardless of how precise you personally think it is, many (read: most) others will not be able to understand it what it means, even after spending some time thinking on it to try and figure out what you\u2019re trying to say.  Do not think that simply because we cannot find a middle ground to meet at it is all my own misguided intuitions, for to do so would be to make the very mistake you're accusing me of.   > To clarify what I mean by this, note that you\u2019ve repeatedly paid this possibility lip service\u2014that your intuitions may well simply be false. Yet just as repeatedly you shrug this possibility aside as if insignificant to the dialogue.  This appears to be one instance communication breakdown. I always entertain the idea that I might be wrong. Always. That doesn't mean I assume that I am, or stop making an argument, or stop entertaining ideas, or stop attempting to figure out the specific ways in which I may be wrong. I have varying degrees of confidence about different things, never at 100% and never at 0, and always enough for me to venture out into making claims and get them verified or shot down or sometimes both. On this particular subject of whether there are epistimological barriers in the universe, I'd settle on a flat 50\/50, or perhaps 55 or 60 in favor of there not being any.   Should this possibility end the discussion? Sure if you want to. Very few discussions are impervious to such a qualification.  > In your efforts to \u201c[not even attempt to] look at the various implications and extrapolations scientists and philosophers have come up with over the years,\u201d your words suggest an underlying assumption that you actually are looking at \u201cjust the mathematical inequality principle itself.\u201d   This is fair. I don't have a good enough understanding directly of the mathematical inequalities to speak of the principle itself, so I shouldn't have used that phrasing. I was using what I've read physicists have written about it, not the principal itself. Still powering through to my original question, noting my \"preferred reality\" is just \"reality,\" what is the other options besides: a) a particle has a partially hidden or undefined velocity when you measure its location or b) we don't yet know how to measure the velocity and location accurately?   > Why would you ever want to do that? This is a prime example of your willingness to distort a concept in whatever way allows you (implicitly) to sustain your own particular and peculiar preordained conclusions.  No it's an example of me trying to overcome semantic humps to discuss the thing that I wanted to discuss. My point wasn't to distort the concept, it was to specifically illustrate how no matter how you may interpret the concept (because again I can only speak for myself, so I'm trying to avoid communication barriers) it has no impact on my conclusions, which are far from \"preordained\" as I have given plenty of indications and explanations for why I have reached them.   > I don\u2019t have any inclination to sift back through your previous comments and pick them out. That\u2019s an exercise for you to complete if you\u2019re up to the challenge. Consider it a sort of Where\u2019s Waldo search for conceptualizations conflating overtly mathematical sentiments with overtly physical ones.   I was asking you because I think you're mistaken and overly dismissive. I'm supposing you're referring to my propositions about calculating a future state of the universe, or my supposition that things being un-computable speaks to a gap in knowledge. I don't think I'm conflating anything, I think you're failing to see the links. What should we expect not to be computable? The other principals we've talked about (Halting problem, uncertainty principle, incompleteness) speak to limits in computation specifically, not concepts that have no basis in computation. So where do we find things that have no basis in computation and would expect to never be able to? To avoid confusion let's use the wikipedia definition of computation.   Also to reset here if you're willing since we've dug into a rather deep hole of semantics (or as you put it earlier perhaps we are wandering in an overgrown field of thistles), my line of inquiry is whether or not there are epistimological barriers in the universe, centered at the beginning of this discussion around whether math is discovered or invented. I see your problems with the verbiage of those sentiments, and I think you likely draw a greater distinction between mathematics and physical sciences than I do (mathematical and physical models often use the same language to make computations (see wiki link above) which is an important note I think).   I don't think that matters much to my argument though. You can define the terms however you like (note that's however you like, not me saying you have to define them how I want to achieve a certain viewpoint), and so long as you don't say Math is intrinsic to the universe (unlikely given your apparent distaste for such a notion), the answer still comes to a point where I can see at least the possibility that apparent barriers are actually simply incomplete conceptualizations. I think you could make the argument that mathematical relationships are intrinsic to the universe (using whatever definitions thereof you think are correct), which would point to epistimological barriers, hence the question at hand. Or perhaps it's not as simple as either of those, and the answer lies somewhere in between depending on the perspective you take, as you alluded to sometime earlier, though this viewpoint is less clear to me.   My understanding of some of these subjects is certainly novice, or perhaps barely qualified journeyman, so it could be I am simply not understanding something very basic and am in no way qualified to make the claims of possibilities I am. If you'd like to leave it at that by all means, I'll continue to learn where I can and may very well change my views as I become more well-versed. If, however, there is a particular reason you think these barriers are likely to be built into nature that I'm obviously missing, or a specific definition I've obviously got wrong that would invalidate my viewpoint, please point me in the right direction.","target":"condescension"},{"text":">>I am.

Why aren't per attempt numbers good for the playoffs? That's the whole point of per-play metrics, they're good anywhere. And no, I don't agree that consistency matters all that much. What if your defense gives up 40 points that day? You still want the guy that'll throw only exactly 2 TDs?  For the reasons I said and will reiterate:   1. Consistency: Who cares if a QB goes off in the Wild Card round only to choke later? A QB that plays well every game gives his team the best chance to advance into the playoffs.   2. Stakes. A pass in the Wild Card simply doesn't have the same weight as one in the Super Bowl. If they were, then the playoffs would just be an extension of the regular season and championships wouldn't matter.  > So Peyton is better in the WC and AFCCG, while Brady is better in divisional games and the super bowl. I don't see how any reasonable person can look at this and say Brady is much better in the playoffs?  Again, overall QB rating is simply misleading. Brady's overall Wild Card rating is significantly worse than Manning's. Yet, if you split it by game (of which Brady's only played 3 to Peyton's 7):  Year | Rating | Result -|-|- 2006 | 116.4 | W 2007 | 101.6 | W 2009 | 49.1 | L  So, Brady has actually had a higher percentage of good games played and therefore a higher chance of advancing to the Divisional round from the Wild Card round relative to Manning. That Manning played so much better in his 2 WC wins doesn't really matter in terms of reaching the next round of the playoffs. He had 5 other games of mediocre to bad performances, and so has a 3-4 record.  Peyton also has a higher rating in the AFCC round than Brady, but not significantly so (6 points), certainly not enough to cover the disparity in Super Bowl performances (18 points, 4 vs 7 games), which many consider the most important game of the season. Because Peyton has played better on average in the AFCC, he has a higher percentage to advance to the Super Bowl as reflected in their AFCC records (4-1 vs 7-4)...but of course, Peyton would make it to the AFCC more if he didn't lose so often in the earlier rounds.  Of course, I looked at the Wild Card round on a per-game basis to make Brady look better even though Manning had a better overall rating by 18 points, so it's only fair to look at the Super Bowl round on a per-game basis in case Manning actually looks better:  QB | Super Bowl QB Ratings (best to worst) - | - Peyton | 88.5 (L), 81.8 (W), 73.5 (L), 56.6 (W) Brady | 110.2 (W), 101.1 (W), 100.5 (W), 95.2 (W), 91.1 (L), 86.2 (W), 82.5 (L)  In this case, the overall Super Bowl passer rating is fairly representative of their records. Brady went 4-0 in games he played at least decently (95+), and 1-2 otherwise. Manning did not have a single good outing in the Super Bowl, and went 2-2.  Let's come back to consistency, something per-attempt stats simply don't measure. Consider that together Peyton and Brady are 17-1 when they have a passer rating over 100. Brady accounts for 12 of those in 34 games (35%), Peyton 6 in 27 games (22%). Brady has 1 game with a passer rating below 50. Manning has 3.   As another measure of consistency, let's consider how many times they've had multiple TD's vs 0 TD's and multi-INT vs 0-INT:   Note: Units are in games, with percentage of games in parentheses  QB | multi-TD | 0-TD | multi-INT | 0-INT -|-|-|-|- Brady | 20 (58%) | 4 (12%) | 9 (26%) | 15 (44%) Manning | 10 (37%) | 6 (22%) | 7 (26%) | 12 (44%)  They have similar INT-count probability distributions, but Brady has a higher chance per-game of throwing multiple TDs and a lower chance of laying an egg. Simply put, on a game-to-game basis, Brady has a higher probability of playing well and a lower probability of playing like crap, and that consistency is extremely important in a single-elimination tournament like the NFL playoffs.  So while looking at per-attempt playoff stats stripped of all context, you may wonder why people think Brady is better than Peyton. But me, I wonder how anyone could think otherwise if they actually watch the games.  And we didn't even get around to Peyton's surrounding offensive talent and how that might relatively inflate his numbers.

If they were, then the playoffs would just be an extension of the regular season and championships wouldn't matter.  1) Like I said, you've given no reasons or evidence as to why consistency would help you win more games. Is there any evidence that Brady (or any QB) is more \"consistent\" than another and that this helps a team be better? Just thinking consistency helps as a concept isn't good enough. It's not like that is common knowledge.   2) Okay, but this doesn't explain why yards\/attempt, NY\/A, and ANY\/A are bad? Why not just use those metrics for each round if you look at performance broken down by round? It makes no sense to use an inferior stat like passer rating (or volume stats) even if you want to give different rounds different weights (which I completely disagree with, BTW. Logically, there is no difference between each playoff round. They are all single elimination, same pressure. Comparing each playoff round is NOT like comparing playoff games to regular season games. Playoff games matter more than regular season games. Divisional round games do NOT matter more than wild card games, super bowls don't matter more than conference championship games, etc...because like I said, the pressures of the games aren't different)  > Again, overall QB rating is simply misleading.

Why not just look at their performance in each round as a whole?

Once again, I get your point: you think Brady has performed better because he has been more consistent, despite Peyton being better as a whole.  My question is this: Do you have any proof, evidence, or reasons for how consistency helps a team? If you went through all that trouble, why not just calculate their standard deviations? That would be a much cleaner way of looking at variance of performance rather than picking scenarios and a game here and there that helps each players argument.  EDIT: I also wanna ask, are you gonna keep using things like TD\/INT ratio and passer rating? Why don't you want to use DVOA, NY\/A and ANY\/A? Is it because it hurts Brady or do you legitimately believe they are better for measuring a QBs performance?  Also, I didn't see your little shot at Peyton at the end there.

[SEP] All of your examples are not representative of what Nvidia is doing with G-Sync. I'll start at the top though:  > Why is it only in the GPU market that people think company A making tech that only works on company A's other hardware anti-competitive?  I think it comes down to market share. Because Nvidia has the majority of market share (upwards of 75%), any practice that forces consumers to remain Nvidia customers is inherently anti-competitive.   Now to the examples you provided:  > Do we scream at Apple for not letting Android have iMessage, or iCloud?  Two problems with this one:  1. Apple has the minority of the smartphone market share. This means that forcing customers to stay Apple customers only encouraged competition.  2. People who use Android can still text people who use iPhones. iMessage (and therefore iPhones) isn't required for communication like an Nvidia GPU is required for G-Sync. For iCloud, there are services that can transfer the data to a more open platform, like Google Drive. The equivalent of this is an unofficial driver for AMD that supports G-Sync.  Now to your second example:  > Do we scream at Google for not letting iPhones have MicroSD support?  This is simply not true. Apple can have MicroSD all they want, it's an open standard. It's like FreeSync, where Nvidia (Apple in this example) can implement FreeSync (MicroSD) in their drivers all they want without giving AMD a dime, it's just that Nvidia (Apple) refuses to do so.  > God, learn how the fucking market works guys.  Look, if you gave proper examples and a strong argument as to why Nvidia's behavior is not anti-competitive, I would have possibly changed my mind.

I disagree. Tucker went from the Browns to the Jags to the post-Lovie Bears where he shat the bed as guys got hurt. I'm not blaming him for 2013, but there's no doubt in my mind that he isn't going to get that defense back to greatness.   He was DC for one year with the Browns, and they didn't keep him. Here are his defense's rankings 3 years in Jacksonville:  - 2009: 4.1 YPC (11th), 67.6% completion percentage (31st), 27th in passing yards, 96 passer rating (30th), 14 sacks (32nd), 7.0 net adjusted yards per pass attempt (30th), 7.6 YPA (27th) - 2010: 4.7 YPC (28th), 65% completion percentage (28th), 28th in passing yards, 98.5 passer rating (31st), 26 sacks (30th), 7.5 adjusted net yards per pass attempt (32nd), 8.3 YPA (32nd) - 2011: 3.8 YPC (5th), 63.5% completion percentage (29th), 8th in passing yards, 83.7 passer rating (16th), 31 sacks (25th), 5.5 adjusted net yards per pass attempt (25th), 6.9 YPA (13th)  And then PPG:  - 2009: 23.8 (24th) - 2010: 26.2 (27th) - 2011: 20.6 (11th)  Tucker had one average season in Jacksonville (2011), and I would say some of it had to do with the offense sucking (15.2 PPG in 2011, 22.1 in 2010, and 18.1 in 2009) and opponents going conservative sooner.  >The reason they couldn't stop the run was a lot of things, like Peppers giving up when Lovie was canned. Like having an OLB playing end in McClellan, a DE playing DT in Wootton, and a practice squad player playing NT in Cohen. Tucker couldn't change any of these things.    I'm not arguing that the Bears 2013 defense was Tuckers fault. That shit was a dumpster fire due to injuries. What I am saying is that Tucker has never been involved with a winning NFL team, doesn't know what it looks like, and has never produced a top ten defensive unit. And now he gets to deal with a post-Lovie defense, players like Peppers who respected Lovie but not Tucker, aging veterans who know the old system, young guys who need to get up to speed in the NFL, and FAs, and all of them need to come together under a new scheme. That's a tough job for anyone, and I don't believe Tucker is an above-average DC. [SEP] > He was DC for one year with the Browns, and they didn't keep him.   Not trying to come off as condescending, but the Browns firing a coach after only one year? That is unprecedented!   But I agree, Tucker has never produced an elite unit, and it has Bears fans worried as hell. But the guy has never been given much, CLE and JAX were far from being filled with elite talent.  But Tucker built a reputation none the less. There is no denying he came to Chicago well respected and as a hot DC candidate. Sure the Bears could have taken a chance on an up incoming positional or college coach, but critics were few and far between when the Bears hired him.   Now he a talented (ish) roster and no head coach imposing on his scheme (Crennel, Del Rio, Lovie).

It doesn't matter what happened in the past. The past is set in stone and has no say in what happens next. It doesn't matter if you flipped 10 heads in a row, 10 tails in a row, alternated perfectly between heads and tails.

But at 500 coin flips you check and have 350 heads, and 150 tails, that doesn't mean that the next 500 flips will be 350 tails, and 150 heads, it would be more accurate to assume you would be in the 600 heads to 400 tails range.

I do agree that these questions aren't as voiced though. Why? I'm not sure. Could be because feminism is originally coming from female perspectives, because we've lived lives where we've been worth less than men and we're tired of it. So the fight has primarily been to lift women to have the equal worth of a man first. I haven't heard as many men complain about not having the same rights as women when it comes to certain things as much (could be because I haven't taken as much notice, or because I'm female). Often when I've seen\/heard men complain, they've often been shut down (which honestly sucks).   But also, many times when I see these questions come up, it's not really to voice the concern of men having it worse in some aspects or to bring up issues, but it's really to bring down feminism. So it's spoken about in the wrong context. I think if we want to bring these things up, they can't be brought up in a way to put down something else. Feminists want men and women to be equal. We want men to have the same rights as us, and we want women to have the same rights as men. We need to become better to lift each other up.   This was sort of a ramble. But what I want to conclude is that if you want to acknowledge this more, talk about it more. Spread knowledge. Because it is important. But do it in the right context. \/r\/MensLib is a good subreddit where they bring up these types of questions and issues, without hating on feminism :) [SEP] >we've lived lives where we've been worth less than men   I'd like to know what you mean by this. It comes back to my original point about there being advantages and disadvantages of both genders. I don't think women are seen, in any way, as worth less than men. Anywhere that's evacuated, for example, is women and children first. Men and women are valued differently, and on both sides those differences provide advantages and disadvantages. I'm not dismissing female experience, i'm just saying that it's totally ignorant to claim men have it objectively easier as a whole. Yes, a woman who wants to get a job in a STEM field is going to have a hard time. But i'd argue a man who wants to become a professional nanny is going to have just as much of a hard time.  Please don't think i'm dismissing the experiences of women. I just take issue with the claim that women are valued less than men. That just isn't true.  If you're talking about monetary value, then that's a different story. Although monetary value is only one part of someone's experience, and is not the whole of their existence.  >Many times when I see these questions come up, it's not really to voice the concern of men having it worse in some aspects or to bring up issues, but it's really to bring down feminism.  I understand this completely, and i do see the inflammatory nature of some discussion as a huge issue when discussing male issues in a feminist context. That said, do you not think that a lot of feminists (not all, but a noticeable amount on the internet) take instant offense to a man bringing up his grievances? I feel like catch-all responses such as mansplaining and #notallmen are used way too often to shut down men when they voice contradictory opinions. I feel like dissent is good, and isn't something that should be stifled by people in a movement that's dedicated to social progress. Feminism should, as far as i'm concerned, be openly criticised as much as possible, much like any other ideology which claims to be an attempt at making things better for everyone.  I feel like part of the reason men don't speak up about their issues is that they almost always get shut down by feminists. Men are mocked and derided for voicing their opinions, unless those opinions line up with the existing status-quo.   As far as i'm aware, there isn't a platform that allows, or at least takes seriously, discussions about feminism from a male point of view. A platform that isn't almost exclusively used by men, at least.  >We want men to have the same rights as us, and we want women to have the same rights as men.

A player might use a VPN\/Proxy to avoid IP bans, so instead of losing access to Runescape entirely, they'll only lose a few bot accounts. Makes sense that Jagex will then target VPN\/Proxy users, because of their notoriety. Innocent players may be banned, of course ( Which, once again, raises the question of why the players were using VPNS\/Proxies in the first place. ), but cutting bots off at the source is a fair trade in my own opinion.  So, as we've established, the average player has no special circumstances requiring a proxy to play. So when a player asks why a proxy is needed, they might be genuinely interested, or skeptical, of a user's need for a VPN. And so, we ask.

I believe I already covered that.  >Can you please point to a program that provides monetary or material relief to the poor that was proposed by conservatives and not liberals? A single program?  That's kind of a trick question. Since most Republicans believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor than government is, they tend to support giving government grants to private charitable organizations (including faith-based organizations). As we've seen with such programs as Social Security, Medicaid and the Health Care Initiative, government control of social programs often lead to their failure. Republicans also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be in place to ensure the safety net is not abused. Republicans introduced and strongly supported the welfare reform of 1996, which was signed into law by Democratic President Clinton, and which limited eligibility for welfare, successfully leading to many former welfare recipients finding jobs, helping poor people much better than simply giving out money. Although Republicans generally support a reduction in Medicaid's growth rate, congressional Republicans expanded Medicare, supporting a new drug plan for seniors starting in 2006. Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability, laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access, all of which help the poor. This is in contrast to \"programs\" that perpetuate the the cycle of poverty.  >Many voters identify as Republicans (despite the fact that Republicans advocate policies that work against their own immediate economic interests) because they actually believe in a coherent set of conservative principles.   While it may be true that \"Republicans advocate policies that work against their own immediate economic interests\", perhaps they realize that in the long run Democratic endorsed programs further the cycle of poverty. To them, it makes sense that less taxation and increased growth will contribute to their well-being. As far as the \"conservative evangelical voters\" of which you speak, while there are some that vote on the single issue of abortion (just as there is a significant bloc of people in both parties who are \"single-issue\" voters). Simply because life is sacred does not mean it is intelligent. In the case of the joke made by the OP, the comparison to animals is correct, and forms the basis of the reason that our present government programs continue the cycle of poverty-that being that giving a handout to poor people creates a dependency on further handouts. This is the irony lost on Progressives-in their condescending view of the nanny state, they have created a section of society which is not only dependent on handouts, but where a sense of entitlement thrives.

If someone said \"more realism = better connection with the audience\", there's nothing hipsterish or snobby about disagreeing with that when it's just a completely unsupported point that makes no sense. Realism in itself does nothing for forming a connection between the player and the art in any art form. It is the content of the art that is supposed to do that. For example, a hyperrealist render of an apple probably won't form any connection with the viewer while something that's not realistic at all might.  > Books aren't interactive. Books require no choice or active participation. Books are a singular art form, video games are a synthesis of literature, visual art, sound and game mechanics.  How does this rebut the fact that books can be engaging and form connection with the player based on only story?  Additionally, what about text based adventure games? What about Visual Novel games that have nothing to stand on except their story and usually very stylised art but are still critically acclaimed and beloved? More realism =\\= a greater connection between the game and the player. This idea remains unfounded, unsubstantiated and demonstrably untrue, which is what I've been showing all along with examples of games that are fibdly remembered for making a connection with the player, and despite their unrealistic graphics.  That core point, which I initially objected to, remains untrue. [SEP] >You're deliberately trying to avoid answering any points whatsoever.  No, I'm rejecting your summary from a random dude based on my own contradictory experience. You have to make a point before I answer it.  >Realism is not required to make a connection with a player, and is fully capable of detracting from what is.  I have never contended that it's required, only that it's better than any alternative. It's also far less likely to work against the story than \"abstract\" visuals. You oppose this by offering me games I've never heard of and about which I'm skeptical and are somehow confused when things I haven't seen are unconvincing.  I make two basic contentions: 1) all games would be better with improved graphics and 2) video game stories are by and large better told in a realistic visual style. That doesn't mean abstract is bad, it means realistic is better. That games in the past have been good without doing this speaks to the reduced expectations of past consumers, not the value of comparatively shitty graphics. Those games gradually become historical artifacts, not good games.  >\"Feeling like a small child\" mostly stems stems from your own insecurities, not the games' graphics.  No, it very much stems from depictions of characters as small children or in a cartoonish fashion reminiscent of the games played by children.  When you make obscure references, explain them without actually explaining them and make a point of condescending, you very strongly reinforce my belief that a lot of this is based in pretentiousness. And when I was referring to hipsterism or snobbery, I was mostly referring to the kind of rebuttals I'm getting (like this), not the objection to my point. Responders in this thread have rushed to tell me how little I know about real, significant games of substance. You give me an obscure reference and when I tell you I don't know anything about it, you spend more time denigrating my lack of gaming cultural knowledge than you do defending what you've said. You appeal primarily to the historical significance or past critical acclaim garnered by games rather than explain why they're fun or engaging.  That's snobbery.  >So what you said was pointless in the context of this discussion.  It wasn't. People exchange necessary contextual information in conversation so that other people will know enough about them to make informed and relevant statements. I told you that I had neither played nor heard of these games. The only way that would be irrelevant to you is if you really didn't care about convincing me of anything.  How you could've reacted to that: \"Oh, okay. Let me tell you about the people who agree with my position and why you should agree with it instead of linking to a random youtube reviewer,\" or \"Oh, okay, Let me tell you about the reasons I really like this game and why it's really awesome.\" Instead, you got defensive and irritated.  >There is no value to you saying \" I haven't played those games and I haven't heard of them but I did play one tangentially related game I didn't like. Now because I haven't heard of them, what does that tell you about how important those games are?\" That's a rebuttal, that last part, but a weak one that I argued.  It's actually a pretty strong rebuttal because as it stands, you've offered literally nothing in support of your opinion other than your statement that \"it is a widely agreed-upon fact that these games are awesome\". Your sole justification is that most worthwhile people agree with you, yet I can find nobody who does.  >I can find at least several billion people who never heard of The Beatles either. That doesn't undermine the importance or universal acclaim for the Beatles in mainstream music culture.  I recognize the historical significance of the Beatles, I just don't listen to them because I like other music-as do most people who respect the Beatles. Most people don't listen to the them or Elvis or Ray Charles or Metallica or Run-DMC. Just because something inspired or influenced the things you like now doesn't mean you have to like the old thing. I'll take your word that Chrono Trigger was very influential and important, but playing it doesn't sound very fun and excessively praising its current value sounds absurd.  I'll put it this way: I loved KOTOR, but I haven't touched it since Mass Effect came out. The story was great, I just don't like faces made of ~6 planes anymore.  >Walking Dead game, Killer Instinct  That was a bad game and a bad comparison: the Telltale game was available on mobile, could be bought in cheap installments and was pretty well tailored for people who'd never played a game before or had only played mobile games. It also wasn't in a genre replete with much better titles.  >The fact that you haven't heard of Chrono Trigger is mind boggling if you've actually been an active participant in the gaming community for a long time. That or you're very young (mid teens probably).  I apologize, but I was busy and couldn't adequately participate in the gaming community, and it's a shame because you're all just peaches to hang out with. I play games for fun, not to participate in a generally annoying and creepy community. I really don't think the gaming community actually represents most \"gamers\", but I'll call that a hunch.  >If someone said \"more realism = better connection with the audience\", there's nothing hipsterish or snobby about disagreeing with that  1) Painting of the height of abstract expressionism versus....an apple. That's a bit of a loaded comparison, don't you think? If you had compared the rendered apple with a still life of another apple, I think my point would've been well-made. Because then you could've asked someone \"which one makes you hungry\" and someone would probably have said \"the real one\".  2) It makes intuitive sense that more realism equals more connection and its borne out by the evolution of art...pretty much since we've had art. Humans make connections by recognizing familiar patterns; we love animals when those animals look like us and eat animals just as smart when we can avoid anthropomorphizing them. We're hard-wired to see ourselves in other human-looking things and that means that the more human something looks, the more its experiences will resonate with us. A person being attacked right in front of you will provoke a powerful emotional response. A computer simulation of a beloved character under attack will do the same thing to a diminished degree. I don't care about a square viciously beating a circle.  >How does this rebut the fact that books can be engaging and form connection with the player based on only story?  It doesn't. I argued that your point was irrelevant because books are a fundamentally different medium from video games. As I've said to others, good writing is critical to any story and I've never disputed that. What I'm saying is that, given a single script made into two games and all other factors being equal, the more realistic game will be better.","target":"condescension"},{"text":"I'm voting for Gary Johnson, since I'd like to own the guns without actually needing them to shoot someone.

I want to know all about how this spookiness works.  >All of the physical processes which we know to occur in the brain--chemistry, electric charges--occur outside the brain too.  But not like they do in the brain. The brain is probably the most complex machine in the known universe. When you smash 100 billion neurons together, make them fire at speeds of 270 miles per hour, with recurrence, and with outside stimuli coming in from 5 different sources simultaneously, and give the neurons 7 different languages in which they can communicate with one another -- you are going to get some spectacular macro effects.   >So if you claim brains are the sole and complete cause of mind, I'd like to know how exactly they cause it  What would be sufficient evidence for you? Because I've already stated that consciousness is just a phenomenon. No 1 thing in the brain causes it. It's caused by a 100 billion things doing their thing very very very quickly.   This is like seeing a Mickey Mouse cartoon, asking me to explain what causes Mickey Mouse to exist, me explaining that animators draw Mickey Mouse with slight variations into about 10,000 still cells, and they put it on a reel that slips through these cells at a very fast pace, add sound, all giving the impression of a dancing whistling Mickey. But then you, the emergentist, says \"No no no, that's too reductionist, I want you to produce the real Mickey I experience for me.\" It's an impossible, absurd mission. Any attempt to produce physical causality for a \"concept\" which is non-physical by definition is absurd.   Nobody in my camp has anything to say about what causes consciousness because it's an absurd premise from the start. It's just the sum of its parts to us, so none of us are trying to assert that conscious is anything other than that. Full stop. You, however, are. You believe concepts have emergent features and functions -- so the burden is on you. You go find \"consciousness\". You tell me what it is.   >all we know is that drugs or brain surgery alter mind. Which fits perfectly the Cartesian idea that the soul is attached to the brain.   Where exactly is it attached to the brain? How does it attach itself? Does it use appendages?

What are the measurements of a mind? Is it big or small, short or tall? Does the border of the mind stop at the skull or protrude outward? Does have a smell? Does make any noise? Can I break it into pieces, and make more minds? Is it like a wind or a fire? If we can't see, touch, smell, taste, or hear it -- what kind of hypothetical scientific instrument would you propose in your wildest thought experiment to be able to observe this \"mind\"? You seem very capable of asserting that things exist without telling me anything else about them, and that's concerning.

Out of body experiences have physiological explanations. And coincidences have statistical explanations.  And reductionists don't view mystery as inanity.

Show me where ANYONE said Solo was supposed to make 1b. I\u2019ll wait.   >budget issues are aside from that.. it wouldn't have been considered less of a bomb if it lost less money.. still lost money.  Um, yes it would? Wtf are you talking about? The only reason it\u2019s considered a bomb is because it didn\u2019t make anything close to it\u2019s overinflated budget. Please look up the definition of \u201cbox office bomb\u201d please because again, you\u2019re using words in which you don\u2019t know the definition. If Solo had budget of 300 mil and made 400 mil, it would be considered LESS of a bomb than when it had a budget of 600 mil and made 400 mil. Holy fuck, my dude\u2026   Here\u2019s the definition of box-office bomb: \"In the motion picture industry, a \"box-office bomb\" or \"box-office flop\" is a film that is considered highly unsuccessful or unprofitable during its theatrical run, often following significant hype regarding its cost, production, or marketing efforts.[1][2] Generally, any film for which the production and marketing costs exceed the combined revenue recovered after release is considered to have \"bombed\u201d.[3]\u201d >Hate to break it to you, but they have no evidence either\u2026.   I have expert opinions\u2026 Which are good enough for the court of law, but apparently not enough for you. Please never become a judge\u2026  >who pays for their services?  Not Disney, they\u2019re paid by whatever company hired them to do box-office analyses, usually an outside firm. They cover all studios and are not some kind of \u201cbounty box-office analysts\u201d that you just hired like an independent contractor. Wtf, you have no clue what you\u2019re talking about\u2026  >Who benefits from this \"it was just badly marketed and too close to TLJ\" narrative?  Not Disney, since, again, it\u2019s \"their wild mishandling of the film that caused it to flop\u201d is not exactly a good look for them. So much so that Bob Iger had to make a statement about it recently and rework their methods\u2026  >Is it the fans? Or is it the multi billion dollar company with millions in marketing budget?  It\u2019s neither, it\u2019s just the facts, buddy. Out down that tinfoil hat and read up on what you\u2019re trying to talk about because it\u2019s very clear you really have no idea.  >Why would tracking say that Solo was set to open at 170 million? Why say that it had presold more than BP???  Because people thought a Star Wars movie had enough hype to array itself on it\u2019s own. Even Disney did, but again, it didn\u2019t. And the factors that led to it\u2019s flop have been very clearly listed out to you. It\u2019s literally predictions, not facts. (Except for it\u2019s presage numbers being higher than BP. That was true, but BP made it\u2019s money not from presales)  >Why? cuz they pick and choose whatever metric they like and they bend it to fit a narrative to serve their purposes\u2026  Seriously, this is tinfoil hat bullshit and you have nothing to back yourself up on this one since your whole argument falls apart when you account for the analysts blaming Disney\u2019s mishandling of the film as the cause\u2026 Again, seriously, just please stop.

Anything and everything has to be taken in context. Even the ridiculous legalism of Leviticus has a purpose and a place, whether you agree with it or not (also do read about the history of the text, it's basically a lengthy priest fight and people sneaking extra stuff in to win arguments.

The \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy is just internet armchair philosopher nonsense. A Scotsman is a class defined as \"a person who is Scottish\". The notion of \"no true Scotsman\" is just needless analysis of nonsensical attempts to re-define a well established class. The same applies to a religious group. A Jew, a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist, these all have good working definitions that make it pretty easy to figure out who is or is not a member of each group.    This is why \"context\" is actually vital - you can't just take a piece of something and claim that it is enough for full understanding of the thing. Hence the pidgin metaphor. And no one, anywhere, is defending atrocious behavior based on the Bible. Very, very few Christians will say \"we should kill babies\" because God kills babies in the story of Exodus. In fact, your not even address the story by focusing on the death of the first born sons. That's not what the story is about, at all, and to take that piece out and claim that's central to the Tanakh\/Old Testament is simply insane. That would be like reading a paragraph of The Lord of the Rings and just assuming that's what the whole book is about.

Can you stop this condescending nonsense if you're actually going to debate this? It's not about whether or not Christians are advocating killing babies, nor has it ever been about that. It's that a supposedly moral perfect being, one falsely claimed by Abrahamists to be worthy of worship, is engaging in the indefensible.  The fact that Christians, in a real-world situation, recognize the atrocity of this act makes my point stronger if anything.  > That's not what the story is about, at all, and to take that piece out and claim that's central to the Tanakh\/Old Testament is simply insane.

However, if your root argument is flawed then the whole thing is wrong. I'm not trying to blow you up specifically; however, so, so, so much of today's 'social truisms' are based on shitty\/circular logic. It's tragically common.  So let's examine your logical root: \"all critics draw from life experience\". Is this true? Possibly, but almost certainly not in a unique way. 'Knowledge' is gained by studying the corpus of that field \\- you become a mathematician by learning math. You become an art critic by studying art. In this case, you'd study movies. To truly make a cogent argument that gender\/race deeply matter and are the exclusive domain of a given gender\/race\/etc combo, you're going to have to make a coherent argument that 'the human experience' either doesn't exist or is irrelevant. That's a huge fucking ask, and if you can't do it, you're argument is critically weakened (yes, it is. and think about it before you reflexively argue back). Put differently, what did Kael bring that was specific to her gender that Bazin or Ebert could not? Or was she just a really well\\-studied analyst of the art itself? More broadly, is criticism about the art or an examination of self by proxy of the art (this is a trick question b\/c these are two wildly different things).  Now where gender\/race\/etc does matter is in today's neo\\-film\\-criticism, where you have 27yr old writing 'think pieces' that are not film criticism, but instead are commentary on personal\/social issues pretending to be film criticism. If you want an example, look at the NYT review of Oceans 8 where the author dedicated 20% of the review to the movie and 80% of the review to commentary on personal\/gender\/social issues. And to be clear, the author should feel free to write whatever she wants, but her piece was not a movie review; it was a think piece that mentioned a movie. [SEP] > I'm not trying to blow you up specifically  That's fine. In fact, you didn't \"blow me up\" at all, Lord Logic of \/r\/movies.  > Is this true?  Yes, it is absolutely true.   > 'Knowledge' is gained by studying the corpus of that field - you become a mathematician by learning math. You become an art critic by studying art. In this case, you'd study movies.   This is an apples and oranges comparison. Movies, unlike art or math, always have a narrative to it. The primary way we process, evaluate, and ultimately critique narrative fiction (and non-fiction) is through our own experience.   Let's take Finding Nemo as an example. People can empathize with Marlin's struggle because they know what it's like to lose something they're responsible for (parents in particular understand this anxiety). People empathize with Nemo's struggle because they know what it's like to want to break free from parental control. These are recognizably human experiences, even though they're fish, so part of the appeal to movies is whether they enthrall\/entertain, while arriving at universal truth (or insight) through their stories. Good movies connect with audiences, in some way or another, while bad movies do not.   Yes, critics should study technique and form, since those are important tools in their proverbial arsenal, but they always relate to movies as people first.   > To truly make a cogent argument that gender\/race deeply matter and are the exclusive domain of a given gender\/race\/etc combo  I'm not making that argument. I'm saying that a black critic may approach Get Out differently than a white critic, and so on, and those differences could be worthwhile to readers.  > Put differently, what did Kael bring that was specific to her gender that Bazin or Ebert could not?   She struggled in her early career because she was condescended to as a woman.   > Or was she just a really well-studied analyst of the art itself?  She wasn't just that, and you would know that if you knew more about her. Tell you what: maybe you should read the book Sharp to see why and how female critics approach the field differently.  > Now where gender\/race\/etc does matter is in today's neo-film-criticism, where you have 27yr old writing 'think pieces' that are not film criticism, but instead are commentary on personal\/social issues pretending to be film criticism.

Ever seen a pigeon get hit by one of these things, ever watch it writhe on the ground with a broken neck as the hawk casually walks over to it and begins to rip it asunder and consume it whilst it's still alive? Do you really expect anyone to believe that he made them this way but that really, until the 'fall' they ate what, lingonberries? More importantly, do YOU believe it? Have you ever given it a fucking thought? Did you just push it to the back of your mind thinking 'I'm sure god will reveal all in his due time'?

Killer whales, with their lovely sharp teeth, have been around for millions of years. Sharks, the most efficient killing machine in the oceans, have been around far longer.

They are all so pro-BDSM, etc. Very alienating to someone like me, who could never even entertain the possibility.

Liverpool's management from top to bottom has been very clear about their goals, not just for this season, but for the next two. Where is ours? This is why I say it resembles a second coming. There is no timetable, no deadline for delivering.

I know that the club is working under massive constraints and it cannot be easy when under the guise of \"making them competitive\", financial doping has made certain teams impossible to ever directly compete with. But they don't run our training and team selection policy. Our injury record is independent of their actions. The lack of a coherent message from the Board and the manager(I'm speaking specifically of the verbal tug of war over when we have financial muscle in the market) isn't their fault as well.

Let me actually break it down for you so you can see it more clearly:  Player|5v5 TOI|5v5 points|5v5 P\/60 -|-|-|- Little|1047|26|1.49 Hornqvist|923|21|1.37 Thornton|637|14|1.32 Zibanejad|931|21|1.35 Hoffman|1163|28|1.44 E. Kane|1184|35|1.77 Pavelski|1191|35|1.76 D. Sedin|982|28|1.71 H. Sedin|947|27|1.71 Toews|1021|28|1.64 Johansen|1066|30|1.69 Seguin|1217|34|1.68 Crosby|1260|35|1.67 Wilson|1079|32|1.78  Wilson is 5th on that list in terms of \"actual\" total 5v5 points. Crosby played 180 more minutes, Seguin played 150 more, Kane and Pavelski played 110 more minutes (and were only barely behind in rate, but were behind)  Saying \"they converted that into actual points\" shows a fundamental misunderstanding for what the numbers are showing.  > And it's not as if he was buried on the bottom 6 all year, the majority of his minutes were with a combo of either OV and Kuz or OV and Backstrom  How many 5v5 points do you think those guys got? Ovi had 48, Kuz had 44 and Backy had 38. That's not that much more than Wilson's 32 especially considering they got (who was 4th on the whole team behind them at 5v5 points and P\/60 - ahead of guys like Vrana and Eller and Oshie and Bura).  People are going to need to get comfortable with seeing 5-6M AAVs because they're going to become what 3-4M had been the last couple years. The Cap is going to continue to rise. By 4M a year? probably not, but it's going to keep going up  >the largest increase I can recall recently at least  Only in the last 4 years. From 13-14 to 14-15 it went up nearly 5M and in the time in between it went up more than 2M in 3 of the 4 years.  >That's not even to mention the upcoming FAs we have coming up after this season, Vrana, Bura and Djoos, who yes are RFAs but will be looking at raises (and if they progress the way we hope, significant ones)  Both Vrana and Djoos are RFAs coming off ELCs - Those guys only get massive deals if they put up Kucherov-level numbers (Kucherov on ELC numbers, I mean - 60+ points, 30 goals), Vrana'll get in the neighborhood of 3-4M given the team control and Arb option (I'd bet on arbitration, honestly).   Bura is likely gone clearing up another 3M - he hasn't progressed and with Vrana's emergence, he doesn't have much of a role. Between Stephenson, Boyd, and Walker one of them will likely be moved up next year (or late this year if Bura gets moved at the deadline, which I could see happening)  >I wouldn't have bothered replying, i just woke up here, but damn you pissed me off coming at me like that. Here's a fun fact for you...like I'm some fuckin Pens fan invading the sub calling him a dirty goon or something. I love Wilson and I want him to be the monster we all hope he can be. We're on the same team here. Not like I trashed him or you or even anyone's opinion. I merely gave mine and dispassionately might I add, which I based on logic that you may disagree with, but there was no fuckin need for that, at all.  That's a lot of piss and vinegar for one phrase. That \"fun fact\" is meant to give optimism when relating to Wilson. Everything else I said was just breaking down numbers and pointing out that \"hey, we can't look at Wilson just on raw points, we need to look at the context.\" [SEP] I only want to point out what annoyed me because I'm frankly exahusted (like in general, not blaming you). I felt like it was talking down to me, i mean honestly if i was debating someone and in my retort started with \"here's a fun fact for you\" I would expect that to be upsetting. But I could see that it was maybe jumping to conclusions. And then you said:  > You don't seem to understand what each role on the PP has been   >You don't seem to understand what P\/60 is   Now you make a good point about Wilson on the PP being a right shot. My quibble is that, well I'd like to see it happen first, honestly. All of this is speculation on what he may do, which like I said before, I don't mind paying for potential, this is just a lot in my eyes for what we've seen so far. We disagree. That's fine.   I do get the concept of P\/60 but analytics is not my go to, thus my using of the word \"try\". Those are good points about the 5v5. Granted. Again, I find it's still a little unproven given the amount he was just given.   Could you not find another way to word how you say things? You don't seem to understand how to talk to people. When you speak that way or \"Let me break it down for you so you can see it more clearly\", it comes across condescending. I get that you're trying to give pertinent information, and it is, but do you think I or anyone else wants to be talked to like you're a teacher in front of his\/her hapless students or like you're Bill Nye (or god forbid Professor Brouwer)? I don't even talk to my students that way.   Anyways, I did overreact in that first sentence and last paragraph and for that I do sincerely apologize. I do still find you condescending but it was uncalled for. I'm sorry. You make great points and you could be right in the end. I guess I feel like we've all been waiting for Willy to become this next gen power forward and the second we finally got a little taste of it, suddenly we're putting him somewhere we hope he'll be and paying him for it. God I hope it works out, it just scares me when it was such a small sample size (relative to his career, and yes i know he was misused before) and it's such a large commitment.","target":"condescension"},{"text":">Steven claims to have been away from the Hoenn league and Mr Pok\u00e9mon has the orbs from the games in HGSS. This means that RSE happens at least before Gen 4 and therefore before Gen 2, albeit not necesarilly at the same time as Gen 1.  It's implied that there are multiple orbs considering the variety of NPCs that provide the orbs across multiple dimensions\/timelines\/realities.  >The first reply in the reddit thread you linked literally states what I'm saying. Check how it says \" DPPt\/HGSS\" and \"Megaverse Sinnoh\/Jhoto\".  You said \"Megaverse\" theory is the theory that everything got rebooted in gen 6\". It was just revealed that the games past generation 6 exist on a separate timeline where history unfolded differently than the previous gens.   >From the bulbagarden link: \"B2W2 and XY happened at the same time, albeit in different universes\"  Um duh. The Megaverse\/Mega Timeline theory is that every game stays within the same chronological order, with the only difference being the existence of mega evolution.  The timeline split at the 3000 year old war.   Mega timeline: War took place [3000 years] Kanto\/Hoenn [3 years] Johto\/Sinnoh [unspecified time] Unova [2 years] Unova\/Kalos [2 years] Alola. Megas exist.  Non Mega timeline: War did not take place [300 years] Kanto\/Hoenn [3 years] Johto\/Sinnoh etc. etc. etc. Megas do not exist.   Zinnia's claims support this. There's a reality where the war didn't take place and megas do not exist. That's the non-mega timeline.   >The youtube video also states that Gen 6 is from a timeline(another mistake, as Zinnia refers to \"worlds\", not timelines) apart from previous games.  And here's where you reveal your lack of understanding. I see why you're confused and misinformed now. You're getting caught up on the word \"timeline\" itself. In the English language, when discussing multiple parallel universes\/realities\/dimensions\/worlds, the word timeline is often synonymous the the previous three words. To jump from one reality to a parallel reality is the same as crossing from one timeline to another. To jump from one world to a parallel world is describing the same thing. This is a fundamental tenet of 'multiverse theory,' generally speaking.   For every possible outcome, multiverse theory states there's a split in a timeline\/reality where time progresses following the outcome of one decision\/choice\/event, and another where time progresses following the outcome of the other decision\/choice\/event.  Let's make this easier for you to comprehend. Say on my afternoon jog I come to a fork in the road. Let's say I chose to take the right fork. I finish my jog around 5 pm, come home, and am now replying to a very confused user on reddit.   In a alternate reality (remember our synonyms here: timeline, world, universe, dimension) I had chosen to take the left fork in the road. In that reality, time still progresses, yet different outcomes occur due to my decisions. In this alternate dimension, as I'm finishing my jog around 5 pm, a bus swerves to miss a stray animal and crosses my path, killing me. This timeline of events runs parallel and alternate to the one that I am experiencing right now.  The English dialogue in the games tends to favor the words 'dimension' and 'world' to keep it kid friendly. However, I see that even this simplification managed to confuse you, my friend.   Hoopa is stated to pull entire islands (mirage islands) from different dimensions  Burnet studies the dimensional research lab  Zinnia refers to an alternate world where megas don't exist  In SM and USUM, when changing between day\/night it refers to it as the other world  That last one is yet another prime example. Sun and Moon are two different realities where time progresses in (near) parallel despite events unfolding differently. In one world Nebby evolves into Lunala and in the other Nebby evolves into Solgaleo. Two timelines, two realities, to universes, nice and simple.  >>Minor sidenote, I've only met one other user on this sub who is incapable of understanding basic multiverse theory so I'll page them to read this explanation. Though, they sort of get a pass because english is not their native language. Paging \/u\/DrasilReborn~  >people keep talking about \"timelines\" despite time travel not being involved  Oh bless your heart.   >Also, the only thing you had so far was a lazy asset reuse on a post-game facility.  Two separate instances lazy reuse. The sloppiness is one thing, the recurrence just takes it to a whole new level of sloppy. You don't disagree it's lazy. Still doesn't excuse the fact that this laziness is cause for confusion.  Let's not brush off the messy and conflicting regional origins of megas. No, your headcanons of isolationist societies are not substantiated.   >What we have is enough.  Since there's still debate, obviously not.  > Those two only happened because they were closely related to a previous game, but that's not how this franchise works in general.  I'll give you that considering the standalone nature of each game. But a single line of text from an NPC wouldn't hurt. Hell, Red's presence wasn't even alluded to until very late in the game.   > However there IS info given that is ignored. More info wont really help matters because this fanbase doesn't actually care  You say this, yet here we are, on a pokemon fan forum, replying to one of the nigh weekly discussions on the timeline.   >And yet, some people can get it.  Which is good. BUt not nearly enough to warrant a broad consensus.  >I do because they're the ones to blame, as seen, proven and not disproven.  Even you, who claim to have the timeline down so well, are still labile to picking and choosing which bits of information to give weight to. You and I agree on quite a bit concerning the general structure, but it's the small details that we've been arguing about these past few days. The devil is in the details, bud. [SEP] >It's implied that there are multiple orbs considering the variety of NPCs that provide the orbs across multiple dimensions\/timelines\/realities.  What's that \"implied\"? Didn't you claim that you wanted it outright stated?  Also, from Bulbapedia you get Red Orb from the different versions of the Hoenn plot, and after that in Mr Pok\u00e9mon's house and sold in Alola (which reminded me I have to go get it). We don't really know whether its the same that changed hands throgout time or if there are different.  >You said \"Megaverse\" theory is the theory that everything got rebooted in gen 6\". It was just revealed that the games past generation 6 exist on a separate timeline where history unfolded differently than the previous gens.   I guess this was a misunderstanding, sorry for that, I used the word \"reboot\" wrongly. Yeah, \"Megaverse\" means that the games starting from generation 6 are on a different world. Which is something that was never said, SM destroyed completely, yet people still want to claim going against what's said\/shown on the game.  >Zinnia's claims support this. There's a reality where the war didn't take place and megas do not exist. That's the non-mega timeline.   First, for the billionth time, stop talking about timelines, as time travel wasn't involved, they're different worlds as Zinnia says.  And secondly, no, Zinnia's claim don't support megaverse theory. Zinnia's claims state that the non-mega evolution Hoenn, AKA RSE is on a different world than the mega evolution Hoenn, AKA ORAS. She doesn't talk about anything outside Hoenn. You want everything explicitly stated yet proceed to ignore what IS explicitly stated. See, how what you want wont really change things?  > In the English language, when discussing multiple parallel universes\/realities\/dimensions\/worlds, the word timeline is often synonymous the the previous three words.   Except when there IS time travel in the franchise and there is in pok\u00e9mon.  >For every possible outcome, multiverse theory states there's a split in a timeline\/reality where time progresses following the outcome of one decision\/choice\/event, and another where time progresses following the outcome of the other decision\/choice\/event.  But we didn't have a timeline split, we had a world split. Next time you want to be condescending make sure you're right.  >The English dialogue in the games tends to favor the words 'dimension' and 'world' to keep it kid friendly.   Or, maybe. because that's what they freaking are.  >Hoopa is stated to pull entire islands (mirage islands) from different dimensions  Once again, you claim you want everything outright stated and nothing assumed yet you assume something was stated. That was never stated. All of Hoopa's entries talk strictly about space or about its forms.  >Burnet studies the dimensional research lab  The term is properly used here.  >Zinnia refers to an alternate world where megas don't exist In SM and USUM, when changing between day\/night it refers to it as the other world.and   Exactly, and going by what the games DOES say these are world because the games says they are worlds. Therefore they are worlds. You are not only ignoring\/misreading what the game outright says(ironically how you want it to work) in favor of your headcanon. You both failed at comprehending what the game says and also filled it with false information. Both of the things I claim the fanbase is doing. Thanks for proving me right.  >Still doesn't excuse the fact that this laziness is cause for confusion.  I don't 100% disagree, but again, if you use all the information you're given you can get the answer despite the confusion.   >Since there's still debate, obviously not.  Except the debate doesn't stem from the lack of info but from people making stuff up and spreading it as fact. As you showed in your post.  >You say this, yet here we are, on a pokemon fan forum, replying to one of the nigh weekly discussions on the timeline  That just proves we (but lets allow the extrapolation for the entire fanbase) care about DISCUSSING the timeline, but not about the fanbase caring about what is ACTUALLY said on the games. You can discuss things and be wrong at the same time, they aren't mutually exclusive.  >BUt not nearly enough to warrant a broad consensus.

What is linguistics?    http  \"Linguistics is the scientific study of human language.\"  Scientific study of human language.   What is scientific study? Well you can feel free to disagree with me if I am wrong, but I believe that it involves the scientific method, which is a process of creating a hypothesis.. performing experiments, looking for patterns, and thus coming to conclusions. I think we all know what scientific study really is.  What is language?  \"Language may refer either to the specifically human capacity for acquiring and using complex systems of communication, or to a specific instance of such a system of complex communication. The scientific study of language in any of its senses is called linguistics.\" This is already stupidly complex, language is communication. It can involve speaking, signaling, and I would say even just understanding, it is simply communicating.  What I have been doing from the start here in my series, is attempting to have a conversation about linguistics. I asked a question in my first post referenced, \"What is linguistics?\"   While I agree it may have been slightly distracting to post \"(feel free to answer me!) afterwards, the fact of the matter is, I posted a question: \"What is linguistics?\" And rather than anyone willing to actually explain to me what linguistics is, as we might do in actual human interactions, I got a total of three responses asking me what the question was. My question was, \"What is linguistics?\" What can we observe from this? My idea: We are not willing to bond with just one person in an anonymous public environment on the internet. I suspect this is because we are scared of risking our other bonds.  I even attempted to get to know you people, anyone reading this. I gave you my background. I may not have gone to graduate school for linguistics or anything, but I live in a foreign country using a second language every day of my life, and teaching my first language..to children and adults at that. If you can tell me why this has nothing to do with linguistics, I'd love to hear it.   But what is happening in our online communications, is we are choosing to try and connect with what the majority of people who will agree with us. I believe this happens in real life too, and that this is how societies are formed. We create bonds with each other, and interact as best we can to uphold those bonds.   Isn't it interesting that the responses keep growing here, and it is all of you either trying to push me down, or to bond with one another, the ones you already know?   I agree that I am giving you limited information thus far. But what I am trying to say more than anything, is that language is about communication, and linguistics is about language. We can keep trying to tell each other how awesome we are to impress one another... this seems to be human nature, sadly. But in the end, if you don't have someone to interact with, you don't have language, and you don't have linguistics. I'm not saying it isn't interesting stuff, but I believe I am seeing a dangerous change in our interactions in anonymous environments. [SEP] >I posted a question: \"What is linguistics?\"  As far as I can tell this comment is the first time that you have asked that question.   You say you're attempting to have a conversation, but you don't actually appear to be doing so. Your pattern seems to be to post your thoughts, and then, instead of directly engaging with the people who respond, to post a follow-up that pontificates about why they responded to you the way that they did (that you didn't like).   This isn't a good way to attempt to have a conversation. It's rude and condescending.

I.E. \"Hey guys, looks like Zed rushed a Hexdrinker\" or \"Look out for CC'ing Zed he now has Mercs\". It just seems equally unlikely that people learn from their 5+ deaths with or without any kind of acknowledgement from their team.  That's fine, but here's the thing: Right now, there are people at literally every single level of LoL skill and knowledge between \"LCS pro\" and \"your deceased great-grandfather,\" and they're all playing the game. And you'd be amazed at how well people can do without actually understanding that much about things you might consider absolute basic knowledge.  The point is, you simply cannot make any real assumptions about what your teammates know until you've reached a certain general rank -- maybe around low Gold or so (and even then, someone might be duo-queuing with their higher-level friend). So you can offer a bit of advice, but then you have to look at the result.  In this case, \"Hey guys, looks like Zed rushed a Hexdrinker\" is a great piece of information to offer (assuming you did, in fact, phrase it like that). So, what happened next? LeBlanc tried to combo him anyway and got out-dueled, multiple times.  What does this tell you about the LeBlanc player on your team? There are only a few possibilities.  1. They know the full implications of their own build and Zed's build, and are deliberately picking fights they know they cannot win.  2. They've looked at their items and at Zed's items, and they think they know what that means for combat, but they are incorrect and they refuse to change their mind.  3. They don't really understand what's going on with their items and Zed's items, and\/or they don't really know how to play from behind in the LB\/Zed matchup specifically, and\/or they're not that familiar with LeBlanc or against Zed in general, and\/or they're having a really off day -- but they're trying their best with the knowledge and experience they do have.  (1) is obviously stupid, and (2) is actually very unlikely -- although the implications don't change much. The vast majority of the time, this player will be in (3).  So what can you do about that? They know Zed has a Hexdrinker, so pointing that out again doesn't change anything. Are you going to ask them a bunch of questions so you can try and figure out the specific thing that is causing them to play poorly? If they told you, are you going to stop in the middle of the game to explain how MR works in League of Legends? Are you going to give them a tutorial on LeBlanc and\/or Zed? Are you going to have a discussion on leveraging a shitty laning phase into a passable mid-game?   Of course not. There's no time for that. And that's still assuming it's something they can be told in the first place. What if they're a jungler main who only recently started playing mid, and they don't have the mental energy to keep track of people's items because it takes all of their focus just to last-hit? You can't help that; they need more games.  You'll notice that in not one of these possibilities is it actually useful to add that Zed now has Merc's. If LB was unable to act on the knowledge of the Hexdrinker, she will not be able to act on the knowledge of the Merc's. And if you say it immediately after LB has died, it's actively going to annoy her. She's dead, so she has plenty of time to check Zed's build. Either she can use that information and thus knows to check herself (so you sound condescending), or she can't meaningfully use it because she's not skilled enough (so you sound like you're berating her for something she can't fix right now).  By the time you get to \"Hey Leblanc, don't use your entire rotation on the Zed that has nothing but MR items please,\" you're just expressing annoyance, and that's not their fault. In fact, if I were in that game with you guys and you said that, I would have immediately told the LB to mute you, because not hearing you is going to make her play better. Either LB is going to waste time outright flaming you, or she's going to waste time arguing with you, or she's going to internalize the criticism but still be unable to act on it, and so she will become paralyzed and distracted by the knowledge that any failed play on her part is going to lead to more criticism from you.

And as you might imagine, I made some bad decisions -- not going in for a dive when my teammates expected one, going in too hard and giving up a kill under a tower, spending too much time on one side of the map, etc. And all four of my teammates spent the entire first 25 minutes insulting and complaining about me.  I can assure you, that was the worst game of Sejuani I've ever played. I did better on my first ever game as Sejuani than I did this game. I straight-up forgot to use my ultimate, hovered between objectives, wasted time not farming or ganking, died to a jungle camp -- it was a complete shitshow. And it didn't have to be that way. They could have just said nothing and had a mediocre-to-passable jungler, but instead they chose to make me feel like shit and have a completely useless jungler. That's not me being hypersensitive; that's just how people work. Fear, anger, and shame make for awful League of Legends players.  So, to bring this back around to the original point. I know you think you're being \"as cordial as possible,\" but the facts say you're not helping. Yes, sometimes you will get flamed over nothing, but you yourself have stated that it's a consistent pattern -- you get flamed in response to your attempts to offer useful advice to your teammates. When you consistently get a negative reaction to what you are saying, it's possible the problem is everybody else, but it's much more likely that there's something you can change in how you communicate so that you are no longer pissing off everybody around you.  So, here's what you do. You go right ahead and make a note of that Hexdrinker. Now that information's out there, for LB to do what she will with it. You've done your job, now worry about your own lane. If you notice something specific that you want to give LB advice on, sit on it until the game is over. In the post-game lobby, you can talk about it all you like, if she's interested.  If LB continues to make poor decisions, then that's just something you're going to have to account for. Accept that you'll be dealing with a fed Zed and put on your carry pants. Reassure LB that her deaths won't sink the team, and you guys can make it up somewhere else on the map and\/or later in the game, so that she has the confidence to keep trying. She will want to do well for you, because you supported her. And after the game, she'll actually want to hear your thoughts on what she could have done better, because she'll like and respect you, because you believed in her and you noticed the things she did right.  It's the best of all worlds. You get to impart useful advice to a willing listener, LB gets a fun game that could have been miserable due to her deaths, and your whole team does better in the game itself so you're all more likely to win. Everybody comes out ahead.","target":"condescension"},{"text":">You're being an idiot. It is not your whole definition but it is a major part of who you are.

Ha! That's a good rationalization of your own unsupported position and totally not condescending. You haven't shown that your conclusion logically follows, let alone demonstrated it.

(Maybe this is why I spend almost more time on Malefashionadvice than femalefashionadvice! The men seem a little older!) But some people say fashion is the art of keeping up with the trends, of making sure to spend a bazillion hours a week researching blogs and websites, and running yourself ragged making sure to always have the latest stuff. On the other hand, style might be defined as the art of expressing one's personality through clothing choices, something that might not change as much from one decade to the next. So while fashion magazines and websites might be important if you're in your teens and twenties and are interested in wearing the latest neon colors, books become more important for those old enough to realize neon is not very flattering on 99% of those with European skin coloring. Here are a few things I've learned from books:  1.) How do I dress for my particular shape? (How can I minimize a large bust \/ enhance a small bust? Make my legs look longer? Appear taller?) Waistlines go up and down with trends, for example but if you know what looks good on you (say, empire waists), you'll purchase several items in empire waists in classic, solid colors while they're on trend to make it through the drought when they're not. Good tailoring for your body in particular is part of this; tailoring seems to be discussed a great deal more in books than in magazines and websites. Choosing colors best for your skintone also might be something books can help with.  2.) What materials are best for me? If you're still in your teens and twenties, you might still purchasing the polyester junk from Forever 21 and H&M. But as you age, you begin to appreciate the comfort and breathability of real cotton, silk, and wool. Polyester has indeed improved since the '70's, but it still doesn't float like real silk, nor will it keep you both warm and cool like wool, which wicks away sweat amazingly well. Books can be great for emphasizing real quality in materials and stitchery; magazines tend to focus more on who designed something instead of the seamstress who sewed it up. (Yes, good designers tend to use good quality materials on average, but some start out with a famous name brand, and then start making crap. I looked at a whole bunch of Calvin Klein suits recently at Macy's.... they were all polyester!)  3.) A little black dress has been popular since Audrey Hepburn. Burberry gave us the trench coat. A striped tee has been popular since Coco Chanel. Brands like Old Navy and Ralph Lauren have built their entire lines around the nautical feel Chanel gave us! As Urthwhyte says, it's great to know a little about history so you can know what pieces are classic and spend real money on something that will never go out of style. And yes, that does indeed change! Charmian Carr (Liesl) was encouraged to spend her earnings from The Sound of Music on a fabulous fur coat, which would \"never go out of style.\" And then animal rights activists started pouring things on and throwing things at people who wore them, and things changed. But in general, there are some things that have stayed the same, and it's nice to know how to pick out a good pair of classic black pants that I can wear with that blouse that simply doesn't go with anything else.   tl;dr: Magazines and websites are great for following what's currently trendy. Books are great for figuring out which shapes and colors are best for you, what makes a quality garment, and what sorts of things might be more classic, that you can wear forever. [SEP] I am a moderator here, yet I spend most of my time on MFA (coming up on over a year, actually). So take that to mean what you will.  > making sure to spend a bazillion hours a week researching blogs and websites, and running yourself ragged making sure to always have the latest stuff  This is my main point of contention with people who misuse the word \"fashion\" or attempt to lampoon it by associating it with some pathetic rat race about who's on top and who has got the nicest, newest clothes. This is not fashion. This is being a fashion victim, and there is a huge distinction. I think it's actually pretty condescending to assume that people who care about fashion are all scrambling drones trying to one-up each other and scour the internet for the newest trends.  This is a great comment about things you can learn from books, and I am not dismissing books entirely. Books can be useful for the static things that you mention, like dressing for a particular body type or learning about fabrics and color theory. However, books simply cannot provide constantly updated information or interactive resources for the curious.   Not everyone is into \"classic\" style. Not everyone likes Burberry trenches or Chanel tweed suits or tiny black Givenchy dresses a la Breakfast at Tiffany's. For people who are into contemporary style, people who are into avant garde, people who are in their teens and looking to dress age-appropriately yet still fun while in high school, books are simply not the best resource.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"I don't like to be told that, because I don't support their conclusions!

If you don't offer another suggestion. If you think any gaming is gender specific then you have not been paying attention.   Yikes! I'd definitely not recommend a game simply because I like it. It's important to take into account characteristics of the person asking for the recommendation. I love Caylus, but I'll never recommend it to someone who's just getting into gaming!  >You don't know the gender of a username, unless they disclose it.  Good point! I'm talking more about when the gender is known.   >Because you are saying \"them females don't like heavier games\"  I'm actually saying that my experience is that females don't tend to like heavier games than men and I'm assuming the population follows the same trend. This is different than what you're claiming I've said.  >\"My experience has been that males tend to prefer xbox than females.\" SEXIST and completely NOT True. Women out number men in buying consoles and console games.  Interesting! So, the correct statement would be \"Females tend to prefer xbox over males\", correct? Now, suppose that in my sample of friends, this is exactly what I'd observed and this is the conclusion I drew about the population - would that also be sexist? If not, then why is it sexist when I conclude that males tend to prefer xbox over females? It may be the wrong conclusion, but I don't think it's sexist.  >\"My experience has been that blacks tend to prefer heavier games than whites.\"  If this is what I've observed, why is it racist? I'm genuinely asking. I'm not saying they prefer heavier games because they're black, I'm just suggesting that the evidence says there's some connection.  >Males are diverse, have preferences that aren't based on their gender ... so why would you say that about females.  I don't think I said that anywhere about females. To clarify - I think there's a connection between gender and the weight of games that they tend to like. I don't think that's the only variable that determines game preferences for either gender and I don't think I ever claimed that to be the case. [SEP] It is sexist or racist .... actually any type of \"-ist\" or \"-phobic\" if you generalize. ANYTHING!!!

SEXIST!!!!!!  Because YOU ARE WRONG!!!!  It doesn't matter what you personally experience doesn't mean you have some \"insight\" in gender gaming preferences.

Suggesting to the male gamers Pandemic, for example, will open their gaming experience.   THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN GENDER AND WEIGHT OF GAMES!!!!   There are all types of men. There are all types of females.   Side note: have you watch youtubers trying to explain a board game and completely decide not to play because the talent CAN'T teach a game? Or they over explain? Or they talk as if they are experts? Condescending?   Stop trying to find GENDER qualifier. It does not exist!  > If I've found that women I play with tend to like game X, why is it bad to recommend that game upon finding out the person asking is a woman?  BECAUSE THAT IS SEXIST.  \"My female friends like this game, therefore you will like it.\" IS SEXIST AND IGNORANT.  Seriously. SEXIST  You NEVER, EVER ... EVER!!!! Suggest anything to someone because of a physical characteristic or gender. NEVER!!!  > If I've found that blue-eyed people I play with tend to like game X, why is it bad to recommend that game upon finding out the person asking is blue-eyed?  > If I've found that guys I play with tend to like game X, why is it bad to recommend that game upon finding out the person asking is a guy?  > If I've found that males I play with tend do not like game X, why is it bad to not recommend that game upon finding out the person asking is from a male?  It is absolutely stupid to think those statement hold true. The only reason you recommend a game is because YOU LIKE TO PLAY IT. Not because someone else likes to play ... because YOU LIKE TO PLAY THE GAME.  You NEVER say, \"Oh my brown-eyed friend doesn't like 'Mice & Mystics' since you have brown-eyes you won't enjoy the game.\"  You NEVER say, \"My female friends don't like to play LCGs, I would not recommend LCGs.\"  Can't you see from \/r\/boardgames the different tastes in boardgames with the male dominated subscribers?

I think this may speak to a misunderstanding of what \"knowledge\" entails on your part.  If you reasonably believe something (have a proper justification for something), and that justified belief is true, you have knowledge.  For all you know, you actually do have knowledge that god doesn't exist right now.  This concept is often misunderstood by fledgling epistemologists: you don't need to \"know that you know\" god doesn't exist, to say you know he doesn't exist.  >Actually, all hypotheses are exactly this. People have a hunch but they don't know... so they run the experiment to know. However, you're right, science has nothing to do with atheism.  To be specific, in the scientific paradigm, there is no consideration of personal beliefs. So whether they have a hunch, or know, or whatever is entirely, 100% irrelevant for science as an enterprise. Science is only concerned with objective knowledge, apart from the subjective knower, whereas what we're concerned with here (in a philosophical debate) is with knowledge as inextricable from the subjective knower.  Think of 'knowledge' in the objective sense as \"a body of knowledge.\"  Think of your \"knowledge\" in the subjective sense as, \"personally knowing.\"  When it comes to hypotheses, and we're concerning ourselves with the wholly irrelevant topic of the personal scientist's subjective notions about the hypothesis-   If he has a hunch (not a belief) that the hypothesis is true, or has an emotional want for the hypothesis to be true (maybe because he is working under someone he is trying to impress or some such scenario), neither of these are the basis for beliefs (justifications\/reasons are)- and so he wouldn't claim to believe it is true, and he can't claim to know that it is true, nor would he say he thinks he knows it's true: he doesn't have a belief in it, and so he doesn't think it is true.  But if he goes into a hypothesis believing (justifiably) that it is true- then he thinks he knows it is true, and can say reasonably that he knows provisionally that it is true, but will be open to further testing to have that provisional (fallible, weak) knowledge overturned.  If he has justification to believe that his hypothesis is true, that means he thinks he knows it's true. Does he know that he knows it is true? No; but that's not a requirement for knowledge (again, I know this is a difficult concept- and I don't say that condescendingly- I just remember thinking about this particular concept, \"This is bull shit! You need to know that you know!\" but nope, that's not the case).  This is also why scientists often stubbornly cling to their pet hypotheses in spite of them failing or being proven wrong by others. They really do think they know it is true, because they held a belief about it going into the experiment(s).  Now, if they're trying to disprove something, 'cause they got beef with another scientist-dude\/dudette, then they're probably not going in with the belief that the hypothesis is true, and thus, they don't think they know it; but that's not what you were describing because you were speaking about hypotheses they believed, but didn't know.  So, when science is done unbiasedly, and the hypothesis being tested doesn't reflect a personal belief of the scientist, yes, they can go in saying, \"we have a hunch, but we don't know.\"  But a hunch is different than a belief, and thus one of the requirements of forming knowledge (justified, true belief) is absent; at least in this scenario. Don't you agree?   >In the context of someone living in the US, when the term \"God\" is used, it's typically referred to the Abrahamic God rather than, say, Thor. I do not have proof for or against the existence of the Abrahamic God. Therefore: I don't know.  Really? That's one of the easiest ones: the problem of evil. QED.  Does that work for every god? No; but if god can intervene to perform inane miracles and prove he's so awesome, and completely corrupt the free will of human beings by making his presence known- then he can certainly intervene to stop rapes and murders- at the least- and no, the theist can't use the \"free will defense\" because they just admitted that god has intervened and screwed with our free will before.  Because there are rapes and murders, we know that the abrahamic god doesn't exist.  Now, does that disprove god in general? Absolutely, positively not. But the stronger god conceptions (ones that are similar to the christian god in some ways, like being triple-omni, having a teleological aim, fine-tuning and creating the universe, being perfect, judging our moral compasses, etc.) that are strictly non-interventionist to keep epistemic distance so as NOT to sully our free will like the abrahamic conception are absolutely defendable against the PoE; all you have to say is that god could and would not sully the free will of his creations, and thus, he can't\/won't intervene.   Of course, the biblical interpretation flies in the face of that. But the biblical interpretation is also insane. As long as a theist admits that god could intervene in spacetime for just one instance, such as making a statue cry blood, there is no logical reason to say god wouldn't intervene to stop rapes- because if he's willing to risk altering the trajectory of our moral compassess and our free will by making his presence known with silly miracles that prove the laws of physics can be halted by an all-powerful deity- then he has no reason to not take that risk with stopping rapes.  >Nope. At best, it was \"gods\" - monotheism is a relatively new idea, at worst it was animism. Wind blowing, 250,000 years ago? Why that's the Wolf Spirit howling. Animism later merged into gods.  Well, I was trying to say that while multiple gods were claimed to exist, there tended to be a concept of \"the infinite,\" \"the demiurge,\" \"the one,\" from which everything, including those gods came.  But you're not entirely wrong either. Fair enough.  >Yes, we removed most of things attributed to this God to other things. This continued shrinkage of the power of God is worrying. Will God eventually be stuffed into the time before the Big Bang, with everything else explained?  Except, the strongest conceptions of god don't have him interacting within spacetime, or performing \"natural\" feats that nature can do itself. It may have been silly of us to assume a \"false positive\" that it was in fact god (or gods) making these things happen, but god as an explanatory principle does explain other things that science will never answer.  Does this mean I believe in god? No. But is it reasonable to? Very. Is the Christian God reasonable to believe in? Absolutely not. But is deism a tenable position? More so than you think.  >Yes I do. I can prove it through a scientific experiment which is testable, repeatable, and has predictive properties. If your point eventually leads to solipsism then I do not care about this line of philosophical thought.  No, no, no. It doesn't lead to solipsism. It merely points out what Hume, one of the greatest philosophers of science (who was also an atheist said), you don't \"prove\" anything via causation, which is what you're trying to do here. You can demonstrate the theory of gravity, over and over, but you can't prove it. This has nothing to do with solipsism; but the point is that you've proven nothing about the theory of gravity via these repeated demonstrations except for one thing: how strong of a theory it is.  >Have we excavated absolutely everything on Earth? No more discoveries? This also assumes that the horn is a bone. What if it's flesh or even cartilage?  You don't need to excavate the whole earth. Lol. You can claim provisional knowledge; and based on the fact that we also know that the person who wrote about unicorns was mistaken about a rhino, we can use this evidence in tandem with the fact that we have no physical evidence so far (where there probably should have been some by now) that unicorns exist. If unicorns play no explanatory role in anything, we have no evidence where there should likely be some, and we have reason to believe someone was mistaken about unicorns existing and then proliferated a tall-tale about it; then we can provisionally claim knowledge that they don't exist. We have a theory that they don't exist, and I've just presented a bunch of facts. The theory is falsifiable, so you can prove it true by getting a unicorn carcass or some such thing. We think this scientific theory is true, and say we know it, provisionally, but we're open to changing our minds given better evidence or falsification.  >Christians would disagree with you.  And Christians are mostly illiterate; and those who aren't tend to compartmentalize. It's pretty simple. Don't mistake me as saying that people who believe in god do such things. It's really just organized religious people I'm speaking about.  >News to me. You have proof because I don't.  Like I said: if he can intervene and sully our free will, then there is no logical way to say the problem of evil is wrong; and therefore, we know (at the least provisionally) that that god doesn't exist. But still, I'm going to also claim that we strongly know he doesn't exist, because it is illogical for god to be omnibenevolent, yet allow rape, yet still be able to intervene.  >Sure but considering people who believe in Gods change laws... it kind of affects me personally.

And no I won't get off my high horse.. Edit: And to the whole ignorance is bliss comment, please do enlighten with your worldly knowledge Mr. ASU undergrad. I have been all over the world doing the work I do and have had long meaningful relationships with people in some of the countries included in that ban. Yep I know this is an appeal to authority fallacy but I don't care.

[SEP] > So geographic proximity and financial means are the only criteria that determine accountability?   I'm going to avoid your use of a logical fallacy again and address the question without the \"only\" since I see how you're trying to twist my words. Yes geographical proximity and financial means are huge factors, along with refugees being able to assimilate in those countries better than the US.  > Bill Gates is capable of providing every homeless person in Seattle  That's a red herring that has nothing to do with the subject. Bill Gates can decide to do what he wants with his money. Do you believe you know what's in the best interest of Bill Gates? Do you know how to allocated Gates' money better than he does? Didn't think so.  > Our values are better than those of UAE and Saudi Arabia  So because \"our values are better\" all other countries are barred from providing help for these refugees? I'm sure you don't know the wealth amassed in these countries that are certainly better in aiding refugees, they have money to burn. In Saudi Arabia all citizens get $10k a month just for being unemployed. Are you telling me Saudi Arabia can't help out?  > Plenty of countries are doing significantly more than we are and the top 10 refugee hosting countries in the world are not in the west.  Ah, you want the US to be the babysitter for all the world's problems, don't ya?  > Turkey and Lebanon have taken over a million refugees each in a conflict that we are at least in part to blame.

But that was never clear in both of your comments.  Well, yes, that's how it works. Progress!  Most gamers with mainstream systems will never run into a CPU bottleneck, their GPUs are the limiting factor in any game.  That used to be common knowledge around this sub even a few months ago.  CPU bottlenecks haven't been an issue with modern games for quite a while (at least for single GPU systems) and only have become more widespread sine the release of the GTX 980 Ti - which now means 1070 and higher, which is starting to affect the mainstream.  Not that it should be necessary to explain that in a thread about the GTX 1080. 'Guess it is ...  Or the \"144fps gaming\" in the title could have given it away, at least ...  Or the fact that I quite explicitly mentioned a range of 100 to 125 FPS, which isn't something you reach with any midrange card.  Just for comparison: your GTX 960 or its current equivalent, the GTX 1050 Ti, would typically reach around 50 FPS in AAA games at 1080p and Very High'ish settings.  Miles away from any CPU bottleneck.  > The most recent AAA title I played is Witcher 3 but I'm still not bottlenecked by my CPU.  Witcher 3 is indeed an AAA title, and one of the better benchmarks for CPU limitations when doing the Novigrad runs - the huge amount of buildings, objects and NPCs take a huge toll on CPU performance.  Your 960 though isn't anywhere close to fast enough to show that effect, it would still be the bottleneck if combined with weak CPUs like AMD's FX and Phenom II or Intel's Nehalem (first generation of Core iX), you'd have to go back to first gen Phenoms or low-clocked Core2Duo\/Quad CPUs.  Oh, and ... Overwatch actually is a title that can start running into CPU bottlenecks, but typically that won't happen below 160 to 200 FPS on modern systems, it's the push towards the 300 FPS limit that requires a mid- or high-end CPU (mid-end = high-end of mainstream, read that as i7 4770k, 4790k, 6700k and 7700k, high-end = absolute high-end, like the i7 5960X, 6900K, 6950X and 7820X and any i9) along with a low-latency RAM configuration.  All of that becomes important when using a GTX 1070 or 1080 at 1080p and starts to be an issue with the GTX 1080 Ti at 1440p.  (And technically AMD's Fury and Vega cards at 1080p, but these have additional problems that limits scaling).  >Wow. Sorry for ruining the whole subreddit with my ONE comment. Hold on, let me report my own comment. Why are you so angry? Who the fuck hurt you?

You are part of the problem.

Do we only provide benchmark results to people who ask \"which CPU is better?\" because those are the people who actually did the tests?  > you just don't have the expertise necessary to understand that you're actually hurting your own interests instead.

At the same time, keep in mind that this is a 10 minute video, not an in depth lecture on the intricate nature of the INTJ mind. Also keep in mind that all types utilize all functions. In fact, both Ni and Ne, as well as Te and Ti are strong functions for the INTJ (and ENTP respectively) what most people confuse this strength with, is the type's preference.  I'm going to break down everything you're saying into sections and provide explanation or counter arguments for each.  These \"possibilities\" may very well come from the INTJs ability to subconsciously use Ne, but I tend to disagree. The difference being, INTJs come to these \"possibilities\" in a very methodical and argumentative way (Ni + Te). The Ni's main superpower is it's random revelations or it's \"AH - HA\" moments. The ENTP on the other hand has a much more spontaneous way of coming up with possibilities. To them, they are whizzing by, and all the ENTP has to do is reach out and pluck one from the air. This is the key difference that a 10 minute video won't afford me the time to elaborate on. INTJs spend a great deal of time sifting through the various perspectives, exploring them very in depth (as is their forte). It takes longer and each different \"possibility\" is reached as a result of thinking through another. They rarely just jump to mind, it's like following a train of thought until you find yourself right next to another train. You then decide to follow that one, while keeping the other in mind, etc.  Their ability to scrutinize specific technical aspects of something is most definitely NOT Ni - Se. Se is not concerned with this sort of data categorization in the slightest. It's only purpose for the INTJ is sensory input, in other words, absorbing the world around them in the rawest way possible. Imagine a camera taking a picture. There is no other purpose than to take that picture. The editing software on your computer is what colour corrects. Se is simply interested in experiences for the sake of experiences themselves. This is why INTJs can become addicted to drugs, alcohol or adrenaline inducing behaviours regardless of anything besides the experience. (Please, do not argue me using other functions in tandem with Se, OF COURSE other functions work along side it to produce addictive personality traits, such as Fi self loathing leading to alcoholism, etc.)  Ti is only concerned with the rigidity of the structures it creates. Everything needs to be flawless like a professional engineer. When you argue with an INTP or an INTJ, they WILL argue semantics. The only way and INTJ can ensure you understand them is to make sure you are staying within the structural framework of the argument or discussion. Also known as - Ti! TA - DA! :D   The point of the non-judgmental, J was to communicate that even though YES they do seem very judgmental, but most of the time they do not care. Elon Musk is a horrible example for this, because he is a business man through and through. He is not concerned with people's personal feeling in relation to their work ethic because it doesn't make him money. The point is, an INTJ (even Musk) does not give a flying fuck about your personal beliefs or values (note, not work ethic) because it does not AFFECT him in any way. Most INTJs are w5 and the runner up is w1, just for clarification. Regardless, as long as your personal behaviour is not getting in their way, then they do not care.   Telling me that because my expectations are high, I must be a judgmental person is completely missing the point; and my Ti is screaming at me that we're not on the same page as far as 'judging' goes in regards to people. As I pointed out, IF an INTJ is old enough (usually by early 20s) to have any competency with Fi, then they do not judge in a negative, subjective way. There are two kinds of judging to an INTJ, and they are very different in application.   As an example:   Person A - Judges you based on your sexual orientation and is, as a result, mean.  Person B - Judges you based on your aptitude at work in order to give you an objective (as they possibly can) performance review.   Which do you think I mean when I say INTJs aren't judgmental?    I'm beyond tired of typing ahaha, my hands are cramping. I think I got to the main points of what you said. Anything else, I hope you can infer based on the knowledge I have given you. Hopefully now you understand that I'm no novice at this and indeed \"know my shit\" pretty well. :p  Thank you very much for your input! I think I'll do a video better explaining all of this. [SEP] Hmmmmm... You may indeed 'know your shit', but I think you're letting a bit too much emotion shine through the examples you're providing.  > keep in mind that this is a 10 minute video, not an in depth lecture on the intricate nature of the INTJ mind.  This is true, though a time limit is not necessarily enough justification for a lack of clarification. A time limit only means that a topic needs to be condensed down to it's most important parts, but those parts still need to be fully understandable.  > This is why INTJs can become addicted to drugs, alcohol or adrenaline inducing behaviours regardless of anything besides the experience.  This is completely alien to me. Previously in the paragraph, you're talking about the differences in how people analyze their surroundings and then you suddenly jump to addictions. What is the connection?  > The only way and INTJ can ensure you understand them is to make sure you are staying within the structural framework of the argument or discussion. Also known as - Ti! TA - DA! :D  From my experiences, you are not incorrect on this topic, though the inclusion of the last sentence seems rather condescending which can hurt an otherwise informative atmosphere.  > Which do you think I mean when I say INTJs aren't judgmental?  I think that a better clarification of what you meant is that INTJs judge based on objective facts, rather than emotions even if it seems otherwise. I.E. \"you're doing a crappy job\" and not \"you're a crappy person\".  > Hopefully now you understand that I'm no novice at this and indeed \"know my shit\" pretty well. :p  I don't think saying this would help any argument\/discussion, just seems a bit cocky.  ---  In regards to things you might of missed from the original comment;  > Your description of Ni as \"possibilities\" and thinking 30-40 years into the future is pretty broadly applicable. Zooming in on a single point of data may relate to Se-Ni, but it really depends on what you're actually talking about.  My interpretation of the video was that an INTJ can think of and dissect something 30-40 years out, even if they can't come up with a scheduled plan for that length of time, but I think you focused more on the differences between ENTP and INTJ rather than the question at hand.  > Another common enneagram type for the INTJ is E5, they are still intense, withdrawn, detached and nihilistic. These INTJs are more similar to INTP, probably a lot less judgemental for the reasons you give: they don't care that much, they might not even take care of their own personal hygiene, room is a mess etc. because they are pretty much detached from the whole world, a walking brain, but again that's not really like what you describe.

Despite the fact that they were in the news for only about a month, the group had been around for over twenty years.   I would know - I was raised in it.  One of the horrible aspects of May 21st is that people were commanded to sell of their houses, quit their jobs, take their kids out of school, ect because continuing a normal instead of preparing for the rapture proved someone to be unsaved. I wouldn't know where to begin - my family knew several families that sold everything they owned and decided to live in cars and \"spread the word.\"   Almost everyone quit their jobs. I know one woman who drove a school bus. She handed out religious tracks to all of the elementary students on what she thought was her last day. It probably was on the account that parents probably rang the school up about the crazy pamphlets she was handing out and how it scared the students.   There were also numerous divorces. One spouse would think the whole thing was crazy, pick up, and leave. One woman's husband took their child and left, and after the whole May 21st fiasco she still couldn't find them. I don't know if she ever has.   There was a lot of discussion about what to do with pets - I know one man who put down his healthy dog. That really broke my heart. I remember crying over both my dog and cat, and not being able to sleep because of what God was supposedly going to do and how it was going to hurt my best friends. I asked God to just do it quickly.  I didn't quit my job (my parents were not happy about that because it made it seem like I didn't have faith that the world was going to end), but I dropped out of school, and gave away ALL of my money to the group. There were few cases (at least that I know of) that involved people running up debt. Mostly because doing so \"proved\" someone was unsaved.  I picked up after it all happened. I got two jobs to try and make up for the money I lost, I worked my ass off in community college and am now in the university of my dreams, and am trying to transition into a normal life. It's very difficult. I was raised in a cult and it's impossible to relate to people sometimes. Religiously, I couldn't be better. I am probably too cynical about religion, but I feel good going to bed each night, being an atheist. I feel so much better and life is looking up. I've dramatically changed.  Everyone else varies though. There are plenty of people who are trying to figure out what happened and plan for the next date of the rapture. These people will ALWAYS be around. For the most part people are just trying to get by - get what jobs they can and take care of their kids. I know a lot of the younger people are relieved, and feel guilty to feel relieved. (Feeling relieved means that you didn't actually want it to happen, which means that you don't trust in God's will, which means you're unsaved and going to hell). I think I struggle less internally than most of the younger people I know. Most are trying to still be some sort of Christian and make some sort of life out of the mess. It's all very, very sad.  Chances are though, it's the worse event that will happen (or not happen) in our lives. Whenever I'm having a shit day I try to remember that.  EDIT: I should mention that I am not quite 100% better. Religiously speaking, I am better off than most of the other young people. Most of them are trying to reconcile and still believe in God or bits of the May 21st theory, ect while I'm religiously over all of it. But as far as my health mentally, socially, and even sexually I am.....not really all the way there. I'm working on it, but there's a lot of shit to work through after more than 20 years. That's one of the reasons I'm always trying to track down people who went through similar events that I did. I feel like we can relate to each other in ways that others don't quite get. Also, I can't really tell my new friends - this is a lot to throw on someone out of no where. It's a lot of baggage. I'm really the only one in my family who left, so it's a bit lonely, ya know?

I'm not sure why the terms \"casual sex\" and \"promiscuity\" are in quotation marks: these are terms with clear meaning.   2. Attributing an opposition to casual sex exclusively to Catholicism is historically ignorant. What about the Jews? The Orthodox? The Muslims? All of the tribes across the globe who have practiced slut-shaming?  3. To return to the first point made in this response, it has not yet been demonstrated that casual sex was rampant in ancient societies. The risk of pregnancy was very real. Women were not yet treated as fully human. Promiscuous behavior was ubiquitously condemned, even in Roman society. What you're doing is what we in philosophy would understand as assertion-making rather than argument-making.  >They are going to have sex no matter how hard people like you try to tell them not to in useless abstinence-only sex ed programs.  Is there a single society in human history that has successfully discouraged young adults from having casual sex? (There are hundreds, but even *one* suffices to demonstrate my point.) Yes? Then it *is* possible to dissuade young adults from having casual sex. Your biological fatalism regarding promiscuity simply isn't backed by the historical record.  Let me go over the three main claims I've made:  1. Birth control is far more reliable and available than it's been in the past.  2. Having casual sex in the past was a far riskier proposition than it is today.  3. Consequently from [1] and [2], people today are having far more sex than they did in the past.  Feel free to address any of these points specifically.  [SEP] >I'm not accepting this because it's not an historical fact. Extra-marital sex happened, of course -- but \"widespread\"? What do you mean by \"widespread\"? Where is your evidence?  Do you *read*? Because it sounds like you haven't. Or you can't. One or the other.  Foucault's *History of Sexuality*. McGinn's *Prostitution, Sexuality and Law in Ancient Rome*. Langland's *Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome*. Milton Diamond has a book on the sexual habits of pre-contact Polynesian cultures. There's copious quantities of ancient Greek historians and theologians who have written famous works that contain historical evidence pertaining to the sexual practices of the era. Indian philosophies and religions all reveal very open minded approaches to sex and sexuality. There's recovered graffiti from Pompeii and other Greek and Roman cities that reveal every-day culture that is as raunchy and sexualized as ours is today, and *that's between just ordinary Greeks and Romans*, not concubines or prostitutes.  What more evidence to you fucking want? Holy shit, man. There's multitudes of published work out there that make it blatantly clear that extra-marital sex was most certainly a persistent thing throughout human history and numerous cultures. SOME of these cultures were intensely patriarchal and tolerated extra-marital sex only in the case of men, but those men exercised their privilege widely. They had sex with prostitutes, concubines *and regular unmarried women* alike. Married women were persecuted for it, but that doesn't change the fact that casual sex existed in these ancient patriarchal societies.  >I never said this.  Yes, you did. Don't be dishonest.  >I'm not sure why the terms \"casual sex\" and \"promiscuity\" are in quotation marks: these are terms with clear meaning.  They're in quotes because they are *moral judgements* that you are committing to and I am not. I don't consider it casual sex. I consider it sex. Just *normal* sex. I don't consider it promiscuity. I consider it *normal human behavior*. So when I use those phrases, I quote you. Hence the quotation marks.  Not that complicated.  >Attributing an opposition to casual sex exclusively to Catholicism is historically ignorant. What about the Jews? The Orthodox? The Muslims?   Once again, it's evident that you do not read.  Jews are historically closed societies. Judaism was present prior to Christianity, obviously, but it wasn't widespread. The nature of their religion is accepting of converts, but they don't seek converts out. Therefore, historically, the Jewish religious culture was a non-influential minority within the Roman Empire, and did not affect the Roman law and culture.  I attributed the *Western* emergence of this phenomenon to Catholicism. I am focused to this geographical region because that's what pertains to our existence today in the Western countries we reside in. We trace our cultural heritage to Catholic European countries, not Muslim Middle Eastern ones.  Nuance much?  >All of the tribes across the globe who have practiced slut-shaming?  Really? Because the tribal cultures of Polynesia might have something to say about that.  Before you cry at me about sources, it's cited above. Just a reminder, because I'm sure you didn't read.  >To return to the first point made in this response, it has not yet been demonstrated that casual sex was rampant in ancient societies.  It has. Just because you can't be bothered to educate yourself doesn't mean that your incomplete world view is absolute truth. Get over yourself.  >The risk of pregnancy was very real.  Yes, it was. But instead of *not* having sex, people used whatever methods available to them to reduce the risk and had sex anyway. The methods were *good enough* that extra-marital sex persisted as a part of our species' existence.  >Women were not yet treated as fully human.  So? Doesn't mean that there was no extra-marital sex.  >Promiscuous behavior was ubiquitously condemned, even in Roman society.  No, it wasn't. Multiple books on this subject. Cited some above. Should go read. But wait, I forgot you don't do that. Nevermind.  >Is there a single society in human history that has successfully discouraged young adults from having casual sex?   There are always societies that have discouraged *SOME* young adults from having \"casual sex\". Doesn't mean that a substantially larger number of them don't simply do what comes to them naturally as human beings and have the sex anyway.  So really, you have no point whatsoever.  >Birth control is far more reliable and available than it's been in the past.  Again, so what?  It was *good enough* that people kept having sex in and outside of marriage, and quite often. Some bastards were fathered, and women were persecuted in all the intensely patriarchal civilizations, but they all still kept on having sex.  >Having casual sex in the past was a far riskier proposition than it is today.  And yet again, **so what?**  People were able to reduce the risks enough that they still kept on having it in and outside of marriage anyway.  >Consequently from [1] and [2], people today are having far more sex than they did in the past.  People are having more sex than they did during the height of the Catholic dominance in Europe. Nobody is denying that. But of course, sexual suppression by Catholic dogma is a mere *blip* on the overall human history that extends thousands of years.  The reality is that people probably are having sex about as frequently as they did in ancient times. All historical evidence points to this conclusion.  I've said all that needs to be said here. Evidence is plenty for people who care to see. It's becoming awfully clear though that you're not really interested in seeing evidence.

You only have to look at what happened in Europe and is still happening in Europe to some extent to know what will happen if we just start spending money again.  Certain countries in Europe almost completely went under and if it were not for other countries bailing them out they would have.. and then those countries almost went down as well.   The government will never have enough money to pay for everything.  If you make every state school in the country free for anybody who wants to go, it would make it far more competitive to get in resulting in less people going. The private universities would likely go out of business and you'd probably end up having to pay professors less.    Back on topic, I do agree that the medical costs of the US are high.  Its a fact that they are higher here than they are in most other locations across the world.   And there are three reasons for that.  One is a good reason and I gladly would pay more because of it, the other two are bad reasons and they need to be looked at.   The first reason is that when you take the whole healthcare system as a whole, lump it together then find the average that somebody pays, you have to account for the fact that a lot more research happens in the US than in most places around the world, and that accounts a lot towards the higher average cost.  I'd gladly may more money for medicines and new procedures knowing that that money will go to a company that is spending billions on research to improve things.   The second reason, and one that needs to be looked at is: So many insurance companies do not pay for preventative care.  I could be in a third world country and get the flu and be clinging to life and need to be transported back to the states to be looked after.  The insurance company will pay every single fee to put me and those traveling with me on a private medical jet and then pay for me to be put in a hospital when I get home. However,  paying for the flu shot would save them a lot of money verus the event I were to actually get the flu.   The third I have first hand experience with and is a big deal which is why i saved it for last.  My dad is a doctor.  You should see how much money he pays in medical malpractice insurance.  Its more money in that one bill alone than most people make in a year... and it has saved him a few times.    People are way to quick to sue doctors and the laws governing what you can sue for need to be tightened up.   I'll give you an example:  A doctor a few towns over from me was out to dinner with his wife and the doctor saw somebody choking.  They could not get it out so the doctor  stabbed a ball point pen into the ladies throat in order to save her. She would have died if that doctor was not in the restaurant.  However that lady did not like the scar on her neck and sued the doctor for $500,000, won, and the insurance had to pay for it.  Stories like that are things that need to be addressed at a equal level as \"My flu shot cost me $35 dollars and I think the government should have paid that instead\"  Because as long as doctors need top ay tens of thousands of dollars in insurance to protect themselves, the prices of those doctors are not going to come down.  [SEP] let's be clear on one thing... the world economy did not crash because european companies offer nationalized medical care and college education.  germany offers both and was one of the first countries to recover from the crash in 2008.  don't imply causation simply because a commonality exists.  i'm certainly not suggesting that anything should be implemented overnight.  but (and here's where the commonality really does create cause) the countries that provide nationalized health care and post-secondary education enjoy a better quality of life than we do.  less stress, better overall health, lower obesity rates, etc.  there is something to be said for being able to go to the doctor without having to fear the bills afterward.  >The government will never have enough money to pay for everything.  of course not.  there has to be give and take and sacrifice on all parts - both public and governmental.  i'm not talking about handouts, i'm talking about providing the best environment possible so that i can be the most productive member of society possible.  >you have to account for the fact that a lot more research happens in the US than in most places around the world, and that accounts a lot towards the higher average cost.  this is true.  HOWEVER (and i've worked for big pharma), a lot of those costs are also going to \"make up for\" revenue lost when a patent expires on a drug and generics can be made by other companies.  when that happens, billions can be lost in the space of a few months.  so the prices of name brand pharmaceuticals usually include a good chunk of stop-loss money along with paying for R&D.  >You should see how much money he pays in medical malpractice insurance.   the only way for us to fix this is to eliminate our society's tendency to sue first, ask questions later.  we have become so litigious in our nature that it's become safer for everyone to let someone die rather than attempt to help them live.  it's what happened to your friend and what happened to AIG when their shareholders decided to sue the government for not paying enough dividends after the bailout.  i'm sorry your friend lost, because common sense should have ruled.  but it didn't.  so need to stop being so quick to sue one another for stupid shit.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"Successful and intelligent black women are single for basically the same reason OP is having trouble.

Part of it depends on how much the nations of the world are willing to cooperate in order to enforce regulation of space travel and colonization. Part of it depends on the capability of world nations to enforce whatever laws and regulations they pass.  For example, if we were to figure out a way to colonize the moon and make it self-sufficient we'd be in easy range of any colonies to enforce our will for better or worse. Any colonies would need to step carefully in order to avoid any appearance of rebellion less they get quashed vigorously. Maybe at some future time those colonies will be granted autonomy but at first most nations are going to want to keep control of any resources.  The farther out we progress (again assuming we can manage it) the harder it will become to maintain control. When messages take hours and days to get to their destination and travel is measured in months and years it's not going to be possible to maintain a firm grip or respond to immediate concerns. Any ventures beyond our orbit will necessarily have a degree of autonomy knowing that any displeasure they provoke will offer them plenty of time to formulate a response. So I consider it highly likely that it would begin with a dog-eat-dog competition for prime locations and resources with petty concerns for life and property being treated as secondary to control.  It all depends on what technologies we develop to overcome the obstacles presented by space travel and colonization.

AJ is a prick who's become too cocky for his own good, and Ambrose told Styles on the first SD after losing the title that he was going to make his life a living hell because he took the low road. AJ had the opportunity to prove himself as a fighting champion last week, but instead decided to take the low road again. This week he had the chance to just end the match within a minute but instead chose to be an overly cocky asshole yet again.  The main event scene feels like a joke because Styles decided to make it a joke, and now he's paying the consequences for that. It's actually been pretty good at turning Styles & Ambrose into a personal feud, which is why I've enjoyed it despite not caring about Ellsworth.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"To be honest, Shinji was made, in part, as a reaction to the older mech franchise protagonists. Individuals who, when forced into a giant robot by fate, confidently step up and save the world (or something or other). It's a power fantasy, and Anno had issue with that. So he devised a character archetype that fit the exact opposite archetype. That archetype's been oversimplified as angst, but Shinji himself is a very well-characterized person, angst and all. [SEP] > confidently step up and save the world (or something or other)  The thing is, a lot of older mecha protagonists aren't like that. At least not in real robot shows. The defining real robot show, Mobile Suit Gundam, has the protagonist Amuro Ray who actively disobeys orders and has to get slapped around and basically forced to pilot the MS in its earlier episodes. And then you have Kamille Bidan in Zeta Gundam with his whole array of parental issues and aggressiveness and possible autism. Bidan's more confident than Amuro, but that often leads to its own issues.  Evangelion definitely explores the psyche of its protagonist more than Gundam, but Amuro and Shinji are more alike than different, in my view.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"I think \"(all else being equal)\" includes the block size (if that abstract coin uses blocks to store transactions).

The tl;dr: If you have Rimworld- go play that instead.   The game itself has some good things going for it, the atmosphere and the writing and concepts are well planned out but it's execution could use some work.   I've found that the pacing of the game and how you progress seems to need work. You designate an area for trees to be felled and something like a basic dormitory to be setup. That process alone will take the colonists several days to do.   The UI is a bit difficult to grasp as well, nothing on the level of Dward Fortress but the amount of menus and lines and logs you have to go through to figure out where the break in a production line happens is maddening, the extra detail that they put into the texture and terrain works against the art style in making it difficult to differentiate between an item of interest on the ground and non-interactable texture.   There's also the sheer amount of busywork that's required. You build a stone oven and you assign a person to cook soup. A person grabs one unit of vegetable over to a stove and then stands over it for several hours and produces 1 soup. That 1 soup is enough to feed one colonist for a few hours, so you have a good portion of your workforce cooking food at all times. Then a stove breaks and you have to manually click to have it repaired, which could cause a chain break that results in a good portion of your colony starving.   I only have about 20-30 hours into the game and this is from months ago- but everytime I pick it up I think to myself \"Why am I not playing Rimworld instead?\" Every mechanic and feature of the game is done better in Rimworld, there's even a Lovecraft mod for Rimworld now too.

But it's not a matter of taste that the majority of static methods would be better as non-static methods. This is a hypothesis that may or may not be true, but is testable as long as you believe in the methodologies of modern software engineering research.  Fair enough.  > They're not really static methods for this purpose though, because testing is all about getting software in a particular state (and then verifying this state is as expected). Functional programming is so testable because it (ideally) has no state! If a function f is totally defined by its arguments a, b and c, then we can simply test f with every permutation of a, b, and c, perhaps pruning this space if it is too large.  Exactly, and there's nothing to stop one from writing in this style in OO languages as well!* This is why I think that static methods are not necessarily procedural and not necessarily hard to test.  *I don't mean writing the WHOLE program this way, but parts of it.","target":"not condescension"},{"text":"Possibly make it so that you can only put one prison pearl per container (chest, furnace, etc)?

However, I did not argue that \"I want Asian comics to do, ideally, 0% Asian jokes\". The problem is that Asian comedians can't really succeed as of now without having most of their repertoire being Asian jokes, because the play on Asian stereotypes are almost expected of them. There really isn't a choice. My ideal would be that both the 80%s and the 0%s are able to find success.  > And I pointed out that the comics that Asians most enjoy seeing are actually people that do a lot of Asian jokes.  How did you conclude this???? Why do you say Asians prefer cheap Asian jokes more than just a clever comedy? Asians (probably we are talking about western Asian immigrants only) liking Russell Peter might be because of the shared immigrant experience. Or maybe it is because all other Asian comedian who refrain from Asian jokes are shut down in their infancy, so the most popular comedian is the one who make the joke in the most relatively respectful way and they can identify the closest to compared to all existing comedians. [SEP] >I did not argue that \"I want Asian comics to do, ideally, 0% Asian jokes\".
