Fortunately this one apparently didn't cause any damage, but it was no slouch either at a magnitude 6.4.  Had the earthquake struck in a little different location, who know what might have happened.  This is the same place that got hit with an 8.8 a couple years ago.  Remember that one?  That was so sad.  It triggered a tsunami and 500 people were killed.  Not to mention the fact that there were 220,000 homes lost.  One piece of good news at least, since the 8.8 earthquake, they have put in a warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis.  Thank God for that.  That certainly can't prevent any earthquakes from happening, but at least maybe it will save some lives if, or should I say \"when\", the next earthquake occurs.","target":"empathy"},{"text":"Things seem to be quite bad in Yemen.
