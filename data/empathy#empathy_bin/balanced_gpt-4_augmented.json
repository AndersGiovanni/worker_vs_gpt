Recognizing the commendable officers out there, it's still the rogue ones who end up giving the rest a bad reputation. More stringent vetting process must be implemented before admitting someone into the police academy, including exhaustive background checks. Opening fire in self-defense against armed suspects is reasonable, but for a white officer to shoot an unarmed black man without any reasonable cause is absolutely wrong."

I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning.

Unfortunately, similar diversity issues claimed the \"Big Mike\" bananas back in the 60s. The idea of using wild bananas to create new banana breeds warrants further scrutiny in terms of pricing. The potential escalation of banana prices is worrisome.
