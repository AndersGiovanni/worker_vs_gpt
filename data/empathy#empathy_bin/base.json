Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens.

Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

I didn't realize how much food we waste and how inefficient we are in this respect. I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.","target":"empathy"},{"text":"So I feel birth is birth. What difference does it make it you gave it vaginal or c-section. So people can be so evil in this world. You were pregnant and carried that baby in your belly for 8 to 9 months. Some ladies are faced with a life or death even choice. We have to do what is right for our babies but mostly for ourselves. I know you think wow selfish much, No this i why. If you are not here you can not raise and happy healthy family. Next if you are not your best or at 100% you really can not give your all.","target":"empathy"},{"text":"I read that apparently a man in Georgia was accused of deliberately leaving his son in the car to die from the heat. I really hope he gets the death penalty and they leave him in a hot car just like he did to his son.

I feel bad for these veterans that had to experience this as a result from the Vietnam War. I know someone that has fought in the Vietnam War and he has seen other soldiers being diagnosed as a result of the war. It's sad to see these soldiers go through so much trauma and disgust after the war. With the increasing rate of the mental health issue, it makes me worry even more.","target":"empathy"},{"text":"The human rights groups are right. It is brutal. I'm glad we don't punish people like that in our country, but I also feel like this guy in question deserves it. The problem is that punishments like that end up being applied to people who don't deserve it too. In this particular case, I don't feel bad for the guy at all. He's a monster.","target":"not empathy"},{"text":"Hey bro you been hearing about that shooting in  Charlotte, N.C? Isn't that pretty messed up that all these police shootings and racial black lives matter approach to life and living day to day? I ready that 16 cops were injured due to a protest\/standoff. I guess they say the cop shot the black man and he was even unarmed. Why so theey have to shot someone when they don't even have a chance to defend themselves. It is very sad world we all live in these days. No one can get along but shooting and fighting you best believe they can do all that.","target":"empathy"},{"text":"If you are wearing contacts for your vision to improve then you should be sure to take them out when sleeping.

Tensing, 26, testified he feared he was going to be killed. Prosecutors said repeatedly the evidence contradicted Tensing\u2019s story.

I don't want to make too big a deal about this because it is a different culture and it would be difficult to get the full gist without knowing too much about it.  With that said, it's is pretty worrisome, in this country as well, how much people are telling everyone what they should and shouldn't be doing.  Live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is pretty ridiculous by any standard.","target":"not empathy"},{"text":"It saddens me to think about a young rino passing away.

Could you imagine? The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!
