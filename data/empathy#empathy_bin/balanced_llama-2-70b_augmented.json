Just read an article about bananas, the kind you buy in a supermarket, which are apparently called Cavendish bananas and are expressly considered \"commercial\". Apparently, commercial bananas are under threat due to their lack of genetic diversity, making them prone to fungal diseases -- another variation, \"Big Mike\", went the way of the buffalo in the 60s for the same reason. I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning. It might be possible in someplace like the U.S., where we have money for R & D, but I worry about how this would affect people in poorer countries.",

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count \"early deaths\" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate.",

I guess that several years ago, the government came up with this program to get internet and technology in to schools and make it possible for as many or all students to have access to computers and the internet. However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do. Doesn't the government just infuriate you and make you think you could do better?",
